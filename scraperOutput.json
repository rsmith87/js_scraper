Contents  1 Biography 2 In-game  2.1 Quotes   3 References    Biography[] \"Talva\" was a member of the Crimsonblade, who impersonated the real Talva Silvertongue as part of the Crimsonblades' scam to pass off their haven as Port Justinian, after luring in ship captains.  Things went awry with the arrival of Roul Terrago, or more specifically, a hero/group of heroes who arrived at the same time. They tried to convince Roul that this wasn't Port Justinian, but he didn't listen to them. \"Talva\" escorted Roul to his cabin, while setting his pirates on the interloper(s). Inside the cabin of the pirates' ship, Roul became more suspicious, and \"Talva\" lost patience. He ordered his men to take Roul away, while he and his men fought the hero(es). However, \"Talva\" was killed, and Roul saved.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     In-game[]          \"Talva\" in-game    \"Talva\" appears in Crimsonblade Haven during the \"Broken Compass\" side quest. He is an NPC in this stage of the quest, but later appears as a Super Unique monster on Rhodri's Ship, where he is fought inside the ship's cabin. His attack pattern appears similar (if not identical) to Rhodri the Red.  Quotes[] \"Master Roul, please don't be fooled by the local scoundrels. They'll cheat you as soon as soon as your eyelids drop. Come, allow me to escort you to my cabin so that we can discuss the...delivery of your cargo.\" (upon being encountered) \"Boys!

It may be nominated a bounty. The Nephalem may encounter two Angelic Warriors in the field, next to a damaged ballista. They will say that Imperius sent them to provide a distraction, in order to allow the Nephalem to get closer to Pandemonium Fortress undetected. To do so, they need someone to protect them while they repair the siege engine. Upon accepting the quest, increasing numbers of Winged Talus will start to pour from the surrounding chasms, coming in waves. Their flow is truly massive, up to hundred at once, so a hero without steady output or sufficient protection may have difficulties dispatching them. Angels' progress in repairs will be shown as a red progress bar.  The challenge is not time-based, but rather requires the angels to perform their repairs uninterrupted, making them stop if attacked. They cannot be killed, and will yell to the Nephalem to protect them from blows. Eventually, the bar is filled, and Sharpclaw and possibly several Barbed Lurkers will emerge to join the battle. The angels will signal to kill the creature, as its death effectively ends the event, stopping the flow of Talus. Once the event is over, the angels will continuously fire a ballista at the Fortress, though it provides no gameplay effect. The Nephalem will receive gold and experience for their aid.

No man has a greater love for his king than I had for mine, even as I drove my blade through his dark and corrupted heart\"  Part 2[] \"It was Lazarus - of that I am certain. He alone had the king's ear and whispered dark and evil magics into it, instilling the notion of an imminent attack by Westmarch. Afraid to speak against the archbishop, the councilors nodded their empty heads in agreement and sent us off to die\"  Part 3[] \"When we returned from our horrific defeat in Westmarch, my beloved king lost all pretense of sanity. He seethed with rage, spitting curses upon us as traitors. With great sorrow, I ran him through\"  Part 4[] \"I will forever live in anguish for my last attempt to honor my king.

Gorash and my other knights were overcome at once, but I fought on\"  Part 5[] \"And now I wander, cursed by my once-beloved king. Evil gnaws at my bones, and I cannot risk putting my beloved Tristram in danger should I fail to contain that which tears at me. I must venture down into the labyrinth to die alone\"  Leah's Tristram Journal[] Location: Leah's Room, in the Slaughtered Calf Inn.  Part 1[] Quest: The Fallen Star \"We've been under siege for six days now. Uncle Deckard is still missing. Captain Rumford and the others are losing hope. I tell them not to lose faith... but if help doesn't arrive soon...\"  Part 2[] Quest: The Legacy of Cain, before entering the Cathedral \"A miracle has happened! A hero, like one out of Uncle Deckard's tales, appeared and saved us! I know in my heart that my uncle still lives and I pray that the hero will bring him home safely\"  Part 3[] Quest: A Shattered Crown \"Uncle Deckard's home--rescued from the clutches of the Skeleton King! I'm so glad. But the Skeleton King? I thought he was a folktale. The idea of mad King Leoric returning to torture this place... Hasn't Tristram suffered enough?\"  Part 4[] Quest: Sword of the Stranger \"I can hardly believe it, but the falling star... is a man! When Uncle Deckard realized this, he was crushed. I know he was hoping for something more... miraculous\"  Part 5[] Quest: The Broken Blade \"Uncle Deckard believes the key to unlocking the Stranger's memory is reassembling his sword.

Uncle Deckard died for those stories\"  Leoric's Journal[] Part 1[] Location: Cathedral, Level 3 and beyond, in any scribe's lectern Quest: Reign of the Black King \"We have just arrived in Tristram, and I must say I'm a bit dismayed.

I cannot fathom why Lazarus was so intent on this becoming our new seat of power\"  Part 2[] Location: Cathedral, Level 3 and beyond, in any scribe's lectern Quest: Reign of the Black King \"A fetid, pallid malaise has fallen over the manor we now call home.

He looks at me strangely when he thinks me otherwise disposed\"  Part 4[] Location: The Halls of Agony, any scribe's lectern Quest: The Imprisoned Angel \"Though my council begs me to reconsider, I will continue with the executions of those I find guilty of plotting against the kingdom. Perhaps they fear my eye will fall on them and discover their heinous, treasonous plans as well. Lazarus is the only one I can still trust\"  Part 5[] Location: The Halls of Agony, any scribe's lectern Quest: The Imprisoned Angel \"I have finally rid myself of the dark influence seeking to subdue me, and now I see things as they truly are. This conspiracy among the insolent townsfolk to weaken me by stealing Albrecht away will not stand! Perhaps the heads of their women and children on pikes will bring them clarity...\"  Farmer's Journal[] Location: Fields of Misery, outside the Sheltered Cottage on the body of farmer. \"I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about. Few farmers turn up dead, and everyone goes running for the hills. I've lived off these lands for twenty years, and I have not seen any bloodthirsty monsters running about. No reason I should leave a perfectly good harvest. - Misguided Farmer\"  Scabbard of Talic the Defender[] Location: The Watch Tower Level 2 Quest: (Event) The Scavenged Scabbard \"This scabbard is a rare treasure. Its inscription reads, \"Talic the Defender\", in archaic lettering. He was one of the ancients who guarded Mount Arreat until the shattering of the Worldstone, a true warrior who gave his life to spare the world from the dark fate it has fallen to now\" Vendel the Armorsmith  Deckard Cain's Journal[] Location: Cain's House, New Tristram  Part 1[] Quest: The Fallen Star, after talking to Leah the first time. \"We have come at last to Tristram's old cathedral. This is where Diablo, Lord of Terror, first corrupted mankind. This is where I may finally find the answers I seek. Leah worries after my safety, but I believe information vital to defeating the last Lords of the Burning Hells can be found here\"  Part 2[] Quest: Reign of the Black King \"I wish that Leah could live a different life - a more normal life - but, alas, such is not her fate. When I pass, there is none but her to continue my work, and the future of this world hangs in the balance\"  Adenah's Jottings[] Location: Lonely Dwelling / House of Curios (Fields of Misery) \"These cowardly farmers have been leaving the fields for days now, but I'm not about to follow them.

If only Aidan were here\"  A Page from Lazarus's Grimoire[] Location: The Cursed Hold, In the room with the guillotine just before the exit; you get the journal from Lazarus's Ghost just after watching the spectral reenactment of Queen Asylla's execution. \"The time of my lord's true awakening is at hand.

With the queen dispatched as a traitor, I may now devote myself fully to preparing the boy for the presence of my master...\"  Scoundrel's Journal[] Location: Fields of Misery, just before the Old Mill Quest: The Broken Blade \"After much searching, I have found a promising lead. A family near New Tristram has obtained a valuable relic, and poor fools that they are, they haven't the slightest idea what to do with it!

Quest: Reign of the Black King \"The Zakarum high priests in Kurast proclaimed Leoric king of Khanduras many year ago.

Afterward, Diablo himself raised Leoric from the dead as the Skeleton King until the monarch's son Aidan vanquished him.\"  Wandering Tinker's Diary[] Location: Sheltered Cottage, Fields of Misery, right outside the Tinker's Hovel \"We should have known.

I am most bruisingly humbled.\"  Part 3[] Location: Southern Highlands, Cave of the Moon Clan Level 1 Replay the dungeon and Part 3 should replace Part 1, while Part 2 is replaced with nothing. \"Enslaving the goatmen was easier than I anticipated.

While we fought, she claimed that Belial used the Imperial Guard to capture Leah. Tyrael: Then they must be holding the emperor against his will! I tremble to think what Belial might do with Leah and her growing power. The only chance we have to rescue Leah is to wrest the emperor from the grasp of the Imperial Guard. Class Necromancer: We need to get into the city. Asheara might be able to help. Asheara: Captain Ravan! The conditions out here are deplorable. Something must be done to aid these people! Class Necromancer: Asheara, the emperor is in danger. I need to speak with him. Asheara: I heard what you did at Khasim Outpost and Alcarnus. You have my thanks, and you shall have my help. Captain Ravan, this man/woman has vital information regarding the massacre in the Borderlands. We must see the emperor at once! Captain Ravan: Very well, but I don’t think you’ll find him receptive. Let them pass. Asheara: Let’s go. I’ll lead you to the palace. Hakkan: You are bold to have sought this audience with me. My guards tell me you were responsible for the massacre of innocent villagers in Alcarnus. Class Necromancer: Your guards lied. Hakan: If you are innocent, then why do you have a spy skulking through my sewers? Bring her in! Leah: Let me go! Hakkan: I detest violence. Guards, I leave this matter in your hands. Leah: No! Asheara: Get out of here. I will cover your escape. Leah: Thank you. Now we need to go to the sewers. I’ll explain why when we get there. Leah: These demons are blocking our way! We must destroy their summoning construct! Leah: There has to be a way into the sewers from here. Leah: This leads to the sewers![1]       GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Townsfolk Dialogue (Hidden Camp)[] Class Necromancer: Do you remember your time as an angel? Tyrael: Not just any angel. I was the Archangel of Justice. My fall awoke the vengeful dead who were slain unjustly during Diablo’s reign of Terror. There was nothing I could do. As my power left my body, I had absolutely no control over it. Tyrael: Caldeum is the greatest city in the world, the seat of the empire of Kehjistan. Class Necromancer: So they say. Tyrael: Its libraries overflow with undeciphered tomes of arcane knowledge. Its streets cover labyrinthine tunnels. It is a city of wonder and mystery. Tyrael: I do not know how these refugees persevere. Their situation is dire, and it seems there is little hope for them. Where do they find the strength to carry on? Class Necromancer: Their hearts possess the will to survive. Tyrael: Hmm. The human spirit never ceases to amaze me. Tyrael: I feel Belial in the very air. I see his shadow behind haunted eyes, hear his voice whispering lies on the wind. He need not bring an army to this city; it is his already. Myriam: My people are shunned many places, but we were always welcomed in Caldeum. Something must be very wrong that they won’t even let their own people into the city now. Class Necromancer: But what is it? You must tell me everything. Myriam: Is that any way to speak to me? And you don’t need visions to see that Belial is in control of the city. The question is how.[1] Townsfolk Dialogue (Caldeum Bazaar)[] Rasheed: Why can’t these people see? We’re nothing like them. You understand that, don’t you? I can tell you’re different from this gutter trash. Refugee: We paid tribute to the emperor for years! He cannot treat us like this. Villager: Is there no one to help us? Villager: The demons have taken over the desert! How long until they come to Caldeum? Noblewoman: People are being robbed out here! These slums are filled with thieves. You simply must let me in. Nobleman: We need to be within the safety of the city walls. Villager: The emperor is destroying the city. He must come to his senses soon. Villager: The Zakarum are behind everything that’s going wrong around here. They raised the emperor, you know. Noblewoman: Caldeum relies on trade to survive. If they keep the city closed for long, it will die. Sadeir the Innkeeper: It’s quite difficult to keep the sand out of here. You haven’t been out in the desert recently, have you? Villager: To come so close to this wondrous city and not be allowed inside is worse than never seeing it at all.[1] Quest Log[] Part 1 Barbarian: The Imperial Guard is controlling the emperor of Caldeum. If I am to free him, I will need the help of Asheara, leader of the Iron Wolves. Crusader: The Imperial Guard controls the emperor of Caldeum. If I am to free him from its influence, I will need the help of Asheara, leader of the Iron Wolves. Demon Hunter: I have seen towns fall countless times, and I have saved those I could. But I never imagined that I would stand before the sealed gates of the great city of Caldeum, knowing that demons guard its high arches and towers. I must speak with Asheara immediately. Leah and the boy emperor are at the mercy of the Imperial Guard. Monk: Belial’s schemes have corrupted Caldeum, and demons in the guise of imperial soldiers patrol the city. Asheara, leader of the Iron Wolves, is the one person I can trust to help me enter Caldeum and take Leah and the boy emperor to safety. Necromancer: If Belial is controlling the Imperial Guard, we must intervene quickly. The Iron Wolves have proved themselves to be trustworthy so far. Let’s see if they come through for us again. Wizard: Tyrael says that we must help the emperor retake control of his empire and save Caldeum. We need a way into the city, but the Imperial Guard will allow none to enter. With the manner of my departure from the Yshari Sanctum, I have few friends here. I must find new allies. I believe Asheara and her Iron Wolves to be trustworthy. Perhaps she can gain us entry into the city. Part 2 Barbarian: We will receive no aid from the child that rules Caldeum; he is Belial's pawn. I have found Leah, but other than Asheara and the Iron Wolves, it seems we are alone in our fight. Crusader: Caldeum's child emperor proved to be of no use. Asheara and her Iron Wolves are the only allies we have. Demon Hunter: Emperor Hakan II is too young; he believes Belial’s lies without reservation, and he has ordered his treacherous guards to kill Leah and me. Simple little fool! We must escape the palace, but this isn’t the end of the matter. Monk: The child emperor seems powerless to stand up to the Imperial Guard, Belial’s demons. I will get no assistance from him. All Leah and I can do now is escape the palace and find another way. Necromancer: The emperor is an insolent child. If it weren’t for the suffering of Caldeum, I’d consider letting Belial have him. At least Leah is free now. Wizard: The emperor is just a child; how could I have hoped he would be able to aid me? The Imperial Guard has him convinced we are the enemy. Instead of gaining an ally, we find ourselves fighting for our lives. It seems we have even fewer friends than we had hoped.

Notes[] If the crown is brought back to town and sold before talking to Eamon the checked box in quest progress will become unchecked this causes a new one automatically generated in the Chancellor's Tomb but Chancellor Eamon will not respawn to defend the crown if his ghost has already been defeated. if the player buys back a sold crown from the vendor, it does not re-check the box. They must go and touch the tomb altar a 2nd time, but the crown will not actually drop on the ground if they already have it. even if the player uses the town portal to get back to town after getting the crown, since this quest progress checkbox happens AFTER getting the crown, it will remain unchecked. The portal remains open to help the player get down to the tomb and touch the altar, but then disappears, forcing them to take the long way back, or exit+reenter game it is possible to just skip checking the town portal box though: talking to Eamon will complete the quest regardless of whether the portal is used Eamon's repairs to the crown don't seem to actually change it's stats Script[]       GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Core[] Deckard Cain: The Skeleton King was once our beloved lord, Leoric. He was driven mad by Diablo's evil. He lost both of his sons — and his very soul — before he was finally defeated. Now it seems he’s risen to plague this land once again. Class Necromancer: I'll find a way to lay him to rest. Deckard Cain: The key to defeating him lies in his old crown. Seek out our blacksmith, Haedrig; he knows of its whereabouts. Deckard: Leah, you should not dismiss the signs so lightly. Do you not believe the evidence of your own eyes? Leah: Horrors have visited Tristram before, and it endured. Deckard: But what of the texts? The Zakarum tomes warn of a falling star. The Horadric scrolls spoke of the dead rising and the Lord of Lies. The Prophecy of the End Days says that at the end of all things, the first sign shall appear in the Heavens! Leah: Yes, you've been telling me about the texts since I was eight years old, Uncle. I just don’t think we should read too much into them. Class Necromancer: You are the blacksmith, aren't you? I have a request. Haedrig Eamon: Not now. It’s my wife...She's locked in the cellar, like all those who’ve been bitten. I'm to put them all down. But how can I kill my own wife? Class Necromancer: Death is a path all must tread. Allow me to help. Haedrig Eamon: Thank you. Follow me. Follower Templar: We must be ready to finish this work if he cannot. Haedrig Eamon: My friends...I'm sorry. Follower Templar: Apologies will not lay them to rest, blacksmith! Swing your bloody hammer! Class Necromancer: Do not apologize. You grant them peace. Haedrig Eamon: Mira, my love, forgive me... Mira: Ahhh! Haedrig, help me! Follower Templar: Love is the surest road to a tragic end. That is why I have foresworn it. Haedrig Eamon: I couldn’t have done this without you. I'm in your debt. My name is Haedrig Eamon. Class: Necromancer: There is a way you could repay me. I seek the crown of King Leoric. Haedrig Eamon: I can help you there. It’s buried with his chancellor...my grandfather. You’ll find his tomb in a cemetery in the Weeping Hollow. Haedrig Eamon: And if you see my fool apprentice out there, tell him to get back to town. Class Necromancer: The blacksmith’s apprentice has fallen. Another disruption in the Balance. Follower Templar: This will be rough. Follower Templar: Do you believe in the afterlife, my friend? Class Necromancer: I know the truth of it...but you are not ready. Follower Templar: We are very different, aren't we? Class Necromancer: The crown is not in this crypt. I'll search elsewhere. Follower Templar: All this pomp and grandeur, for what? A sinful monarch who laid waste to his kingdom. Class Necromancer: I think the crown is nearby. Follower Templar: The chancellor kept it safe for many years. A noble act. Chancellor Eamon: No! I will not allow you to bring that monster Leoric back to this world! Haedrig Eamon: You found the crown? Truth be told, I didn't think you'd make it back alive. Haedrig Eamon: Ahh, it needs a repair. Should be no problem...It’s good to work again. There. New as the day it was placed upon the Black King’s head. I need something more than making spades to occupy my mind. I want my life to mean something.  Class Necromancer: There is no higher calling than serving the Balance. The Priests of Rathma would welcome your aid. But I should tell you...during my travels, I found the body of your apprentice. It was a quick death. Haedrig Eamon: Fool boy. Hope for the worst, and you will not be disappointed. Thank you for the news.[1] Optional[] Deckard Cain: I am the last of the Horadrim. I couldn’t always claim this. In fact, if I had turned to the Horadric teachings sooner, Diablo could have been stopped before his reign of terror began. Class Necromancer: That seems unlikely. Deckard Cain: When the first signs appeared, I did nothing. I had shrugged the old tales off like they were so much fantasy, and Tristram — no, the world — has paid dearly for my arrogance. I have tried to make up for my failings. Leah and I have spent her lifetime scouring the world, collecting pieces of the Prophecy of the End Days. If I can decipher it, we will have the key to defeating the Lords of Hell. Class Necromancer: You and Leah depend on each other. Deckard Cain: I do not know what my life would have been like had I not raised her. Oh, it must have been difficult for Leah, following an old man on a mad search for the secrets to defeating the Lords of the Burning Hells. Heh. But though she has seen her share of mysterious things, she is still unsure of my quest. I can understand; she has never seen anything like Diablo and his brothers. Deckard Cain: The Prophecy of the End Days is contained within the Horadric tomes I inherited from my ancestor Jered Cain. It is a warning to those who could interpret it regarding Hell's ultimate invasion of our world, written by many different people throughout history in many different lands. All known versions of the Prophecy are incomplete. I have spent a good part of the past twenty years trying to complete it. I am certain it holds the answers to defeating the Lords of Hell. Class Necromancer: What happened to Tristram's king? Deckard Cain: Leoric resisted Diablo's attempts to possess him, but the effort left him weak and confused. When his son Albrecht was kidnapped to be a vessel for Diablo, it destroyed any sanity Leoric had left.  Class Necromancer: And so he became the Skeleton King. Deckard Cain: He commanded an army of the dead deep within the cathedral, finally serving the Lord of Terror he had resisted while alive. Many adventurers tried and failed to slay the Skeleton King. It was left to Leoric's eldest son, Aidan, to finally kill the monster his father had become. Townsfolk: You’re the one who saved Cain! You must help us survive the Skeleton King, too! Townsfolk: Every scholar of demonic lore has heard of Deckard Cain. Thanks to you, I got to see him in the flesh! Captain Rumford: These dark events tax us. I worry for Haedrig, our blacksmith, most of all. His wife has been injured, and he is tasked with seeing to those who may turn. His family has suffered under this curse before. His grandfather, the chancellor to King Leoric, was killed when the evil first spread over Tristram twenty years ago. Villager: Bless you for saving Deckard Cain. I don't know what Leah would do, what any of us would do, if Cain were truly lost. Villager: Did you know that King Leoric had his own wife executed? Terrible, terrible things happened when he went mad... Villager: Will Leoric's spirit never rest? Why was he cursed so? Villager: Wasn’t the Skeleton King meant to be dead? Well, I mean, I know he was dead, but wasn’t he supposed to be really dead? He should have the decency to stay dead. Again. Bron the Barkeep: See, the problem is they never should have named this place New \"Tristram.\" We wouldn’t be getting attacked all the tiem if we were called, oh, I don’t know, New Wellington, would we? Villager: You think you’re some type of hero here to save us all? The dead will feast on your bones as easily as they will ours!  Class Necromancer: I would like to hear more about your grandfather, the chancellor. Haedrig Eamon: Not much to tell. I lived with my father in Caldeum at the time. We heard that my grandfather stayed in Tristram until the end, trying to save lives. Don’t know if he succeeded, but there it is. When the Skeleton King fell, my grandfather was dying from a sword wound. He had the crown sealed with him to keep it safe. Class Necromancer: He made his choice, then. Class Necromancer: Back at your forge already? Haedrig Eamon: Work needs doing. No one is going to do it for me. Class Necromancer: You were quite upset about Mira... Haedrig Eamon: I don’t want to talk about my wife. Dead is dead and gone is gone. Do you want work done or not? Villager: Cleared out the old town and rescued Deckard Cain? I'm never betting against you again. Myriam: The world is constantly renewing itself, eternally playing out the same events, over and over again. We can merely play our parts. Class Necromancer: What are you trying to say? Myriam: I speak clearly. Do not blame me for the state of your mind.[1] Quest Journal[] Part 1 Barbarian: The Skeleton King has returned, and he controls the dead. His crown is the key to entering his stronghold and defeating him. The blacksmith knows where this crown is hidden. Crusader: Apparently this fellow the Skeleton King is behind the troubles of New Tristram. I'd like to have words with him, but to do that I first have to find his crown, and so I need the help of the local blacksmith. Demon Hunter: It makes sense that Leoric's twisted form, the Skeleton King, would be revived along with his many victims, but it certainly is an inconvenience. Hopefully this Haedrig fellow will help me find Leoric's crown so I can confront this monster before he causes any more damage. Monk: Leah is filled with joy that her uncle is alive and safe, but I must turn to other matters. The Skeleton King, who was raised by the fallen star, bars my path. Deckard Cain told me that the village blacksmith, Haedrig, knows the location of Leoric’s crown, witch is vitally important if I am to confront him. Wizard: The Skeleton King was destroyed twenty years ago, but he has risen once again and holds the dead in thrall. I need his crown to reach him and bind him to his corporeal form. The town blacksmith knows where the artifact is. I must find him. Part 2 Barbarian: The blacksmith stands guard over a cellar holding the wounded. His wife is among them. They will all soon join the walking dead. I must help him put them down. The blacksmith cannot do it alone.' Crusader: The blacksmith's wife is infected and will turn soon. He must be the one to put her down, but I will remain by his side. Demon Hunter: Haedrig has found himself in a difficult situation. I of all people know just how hard it is to kill a loved one when there is no other choice. I have seen it happen time and time again. But that doesn’t make his grief any less genuine or his duty any more bearable. I will help him. Monk: The villagers locked those who are afflicted by the curse of the risen dead within the cellar beneath the blacksmith’s house. Haedrig’s wife is one of them. When no one else would take up the task of putting their neighbors to rest, Haedrig volunteered, but he cannot bring himself to do it. I will help him, for the gods have given me the strength to see such things done. Wizard: The blacksmith stands watch over his cellar, paralyzed with grief. His wife and many others will soon die and raise again as the hungry dead. I don't relish the task of killing them, but I don't think the blacksmith can handle this on his own. Part 3 Barbarian: My grim work is done. The blacksmith's wife and friends are dead. I must now ask him to help me find the crown of the Skeleton King. Crusader: It is done, the blacksmith's wife has found rest. These are dark times, and a cleansed Zakarum faith is needed more than ever. Demon Hunter: The blacksmith’s wife and friends are dead. Though I do not wish to intrude on Haedrig’s grief, I must know the location of the Skeleton King’s crown, and quickly. Monk: The gods have granted the afflicted villagers rest. Haedrig’s and my grim work is done. Haedrig is filled with grief, but I must ask him to help me. My task cannot wait for his heart. Wizard: It is done. I have helped the blacksmith kill his wife and friends. Though it is not the best time to ask, I must know where the crown of the Skeleton King is. Part 4 Barbarian: The Skeleton King's crown is in the tomb of his chancellor. I will use it to force Leoric into this world and tear him apart. Crusader: Well I suppose it would be too easy if the blacksmith had the crown in his workshop, wouldn't it? Apparently it's in the tomb of the Skeleton King's chancellor. Demon Hunter: The blacksmith is a descendant of one of Leoric's courtiers. Haedrig must have quite a few stories to tell about how he returned to Tristram...But those can wait. I must find the chancellor’s tomb and the crown within it. It’s the only way I’ll be able to confront the Skeleton King. Monk: Haedrig has told me that the crown of the Skeleton King is buried with his grandfather, who was Leoric’s chancellor. What creatures lurk in the darkness of the forest? Wizard: The Skeleton King's crown lies buried in the tomb of his chancellor. I must find it so that Leoric can be bound to this realm and defeated. Part 5 Barbarian: I have recovered the crown of Leoric, but it is rent into several pieces. The blacksmith must reforge it that I may face the Skeleton King. Crusader: I've recovered the crown, but it is broken. I imagine that blacksmith fellow can manage the repairs. Maybe the work will do him good. Demon Hunter: I have obtained the crown, but it is broken. I wonder if Chancellor Eamon did this intentionally to prevent anyone from abusing it. I’ll speak with Haedrig; maybe he can repair the damage.' Monk: Leoric's crown is broken. It is of no use to me in this state. I hope that Haedrig will be able to repair it, or this search will have been for nothing. Wizard: The crown is broken, and its power shattered. Once the blacksmith reforges it, I will be able to confront the Skeleton King in his lair. References[]  ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 2020-02-25, A Shattered Crown | Diablo III Quest.

Find out anything interesting? Class: In a way, I suppose. Cain requires some time to research. He suggested now might be a good time to explore the city. Charsi: That's a great idea! Westmarch has a bit of adventurer. I'm sure an adventurer like you will find something interesting! Charsi: Come on, you just have to see Westmarch Palace! Charsi: Supposedly it was built by Rakkis as he hunted for the Eternal Crown. Before the Immortals found it, that is. Charsi: All that's left of those days is this, the Elder Rift. There's lots of rumors about why it's here...but the important part is what it can do. Adventurers like yourself use it to prove their strength and get rewards. Charsi: I've never entered myself, but it certainly brings me a lot of customers at the smithy. Supposedly it activates with these objects called Crests. Here, you can use this one to try it when you get a chance...

Around 1265, a sea creature that swallowed a Worldstone shard came to roost in a tidal cave beneath the prison. As a result, the whole island was warped by the power of the corrupted shard. The inhabitants of the prison were hit the hardest, and transformed into hideous monsters.  Terror's Tide[] By 1270, the Cult of Terror attacked Stormpoint, and their legions marched towards the prison; the place they divined to be the location of the shard.

It spawned the same time the Scabbard quest was completed (which is a 1 in 3 for the tower and 1 in 20 for the spawn). In other words, there is a roughly 1.5% chance to spawn both overall.

Its people were known to those of Port Justinian.[1] It was run by Elder Owen.[2] At some point, one of the beacons of the Temple of Namari ended up in the village.[1] In 1270, one of the villagers came to the port, seeing Talva Silvertongue, bringing word that their chief was ill[3] By this point, illness had struck the village as a whole.[2] Talva, who believed the village to be cursed,[1] dismissed their concerns, telling them to see the healer Cadeus if they needed help.[3]  Caedus was already aware of the village's plight, and explained that contrary to Talva's superstitions, it was a creature that was poisoning the village's populace. He worked with a hero/group of heroes to track down the creature. They found it (a Maggot Brood), atop a pile of villagers' corpses. They made it to the village, and found bodies everywhere. The entire village had been depopulated sans Owen, who had been kept alive due to the temple beacon. However, he was killed shortly afterwards, his pain driving him to madness.[2]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     In-game[] The village is a Bilefen zone in Diablo Immortal.

The equipment needed for this build is very cheap, can generally be gambled easily or even shopped by a high-level character, but might be difficult to pull off untwinked. It is good for party play, where the Abbot serves as the party's tank while the rest of the party kills monsters; in solo play, Abbots kill slowly, but you can leave the Abbot in the middle of a mob, go prepare a sandwich, and come back and continue slowly killing monsters (but note that the mob may damage your worn equipment, so you can't leave for more than 10 minutes or so).    Contents  1 Equipment  1.1 Properties You Don't Need   2 Skills  2.1 Defensive Auras 2.2 Combat Skills   3 Mercenary    Equipment[] The defining property used by Abbot is Damage Reduced By X. This property is primarily acquired on three possible slots:  Helm - Sol Rune, suffixes on magical Circlets, particularly Life Everlasting. Armor - Sol Rune, suffixes on armor, particularly Amicae. Amulet - suffix in magical Amulets, particularly Life Everlasting. With the above slots and some luck on the suffixes, Jeweler's prefixes on the Helm and Armor filled with Sol Runes, you can easily exceed a total of damage reduced by 100 or more. For reference even Hell minotaurs will deal up to around 120 damage; this is roughly equivalent to getting 83% damage reduction, which is the entire reason why pumping Damage Reduced By X is a fairly good strategy.  Yes, monsters deal only relatively small amounts of physical damage. There are really only 3 things an Abbot needs on non-weapon equipment:  Damage Reduced By X. Resistance. +Skills, especially to Defensive Auras. Your endgame target for Damage Reduced By X is to get at least Damage Reduced By 90.  More is always better, but if you can achieve > 90 in your Helm, Armor, and Amulet, you might want to get resistances and +skills from a rare shield instead of trying to push more Sol Runes in a magical Jeweler's shield Of Amicae.  You could socket Um Runes or Perfect Diamonds in a +skills shield as well, instead of putting Sol Runes on the shield.  Or you could eschew a shield and use a 2-handed weapon, because your damage is not that high due to your primary focus on defense. Try to get resistances and +Skills on the prefix of the amulet slot. You might be able to get by with one less Sol Rune in your Circlet by finding a nice magical Circlet Of Life Everlasting with a good resistance or +skills prefix, then punching two holes in it at Larzuk. Half of the Paladin-only shields will have +all resistances, and you might get a nice magic Jeweler's of Amicae, or one with further resistance or +skills prefix, or a good rare shield. Damage Reduced By X is the hardest property among the above 3 properties to get: you can get + Defense Auras in Grand Charms, +skills on unique rings, and resistances in random rare equipment and charms and rings, but the high amounts of Damage Reduced By X are most easily gotten on the amulet, armor, helm, and shield slots. So generally you will plan your build around what you can acquire for those slots. A nice Jeweler's armor Of Amicae can be bought from a shop by a level 51 or higher character. You can gamble the circlet and amulet, and if you have a good supply of perfect gems you can try cubing magical circlets and amulets until you get properties you want. The hardest piece of equipment would be the weapon. Because you will be mostly focused on defense, and nearly all the Paladin combat skills hurt exactly one target (except Zeal, but the requirements for a good Zeal weapon are pretty stringent and you will not have Fanaticism to help your damage and speed). Try to find the best DPS one-handed weapon.        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Properties You Don't Need[] The Abbot is about reducing incoming damage and then healing any damage it received, but the properties below, while they help with these, simply do not help enough and you are better off getting +skills, resist, or Damage Reduced By X instead:  % Damage Reduction. Damage Reduced By X is handled by the game before any % damage reduction (or any % damage increase such as by Amplify Damage), so if you are reducing a 120-damage attack with a Damage Reduced By 100, if you have a 50% Damage Reduction, the 50% Damage Reduction will only further reduce the remaining 20 to 10 damage, thus equivalent to only an additional Damage Reduced By 10. Replenish Life +X. With maxed Prayer, a +1 Defensive Auras will net you the rough equivalent of Replenish Life +15, which is not going to appear on a single piece of equipment, whereas unique rings and magic Grand Charms can get you +1 Defensive Auras easily. Defense Rating and Shield Blocking.  With the high Damage Reduced By X, getting hit is not likely to interrupt your attacks --- you will get interrupted on being hit only if the incoming damage is high compared to your life, and with the large damage reduction you will not be interrupted at all even if you get hit.  Shield blocking is even a negative, as blocking interrupts what you are doing, and your damage output is low enough that getting interrupted in your attack will be annoying. Skills[] Abbots primarily focus on the Defensive Auras tree, and select one Combat Skill for offense, usually Vengeance.  Defensive Auras[] Prayer - Max, highest priority.  You will not be using this directly, instead you will use it via the Cleansing or Meditation auras.  Note that unlike most synergies, +skills on Prayer will also be reflected on the healing effect added by Prayer on Cleansing and Meditation. Using Prayer directly costs mana, but using it via Cleansing or Meditation has no mana cost. Cleansing - one point.  Use this when receiving incoming poison damage. Meditation - one point.  This will usually be your main aura, to power your combat skill and heal yourself as well. Defiance - 0 or 1 point.  Largely depends on whether you find Vigor and Redemption to be useful enough to dedicate two points for them or not. Vigor - 0 or 1 point.  Utility for running around large maps, or in town. Redemption - 0 or 1 point.  While most Paladin builds will definitely have this at 1 point for recovering after fighting a group of monsters, an Abbot running Meditation will be getting a similar effect continuously in the midst of battle anyway.  You might still want to spend a point in this to get rid of corpses, but Redemption is not ideal for this (it has a random chance per corpse) and you might need another aura during combat. Resist Fire, Resist Lightning - Max.  These are the most likely non-physical damage types you will see, and hard points in these skills will translate to increasing your MAX possible resistance when you enable that aura.  With a small base resistance, you can achieve, with maxed skill, 95% resistance against one element. Resist Cold - 0 to 1 to Max.  Lower priority than your other skills.  You might want to put 1 point in the rare case incoming cold damage is high, if you have low cold resistance. Salvation - 0 to 1 to Max.  Useful in the rare situations where more than one elemental damage type is incoming, but note that the increase in MAX resistance of the element-specific Resist Fire and Resist Lightning auras is greater benefit.  Basically, getting from 0% resist to 50% resist, is the same as getting from 90% resist to 95% resist: in both cases, you reduce incoming damage by half.  If you are at 75% resist and then move to 95% resist, you will reduce the incoming damage by 80%.  So increases in MAX resist are generally significantly more beneficial; only use Salvation in the very rare case where there is a mix of incoming damage that is roughly equal. Combat Skills[] You will probably use Vengeance, because you will be boosting Resist Fire and Resist Lightning, and will probably put any spare points in Resist Cold and Salvation, all of which are synergies of Vengeance. You could use Blessed Hammer, which at least deals damage to many opponents, but you will not be using Concentration, and you are unlikely to want to put points in Vigor (you need to max Resist Fire and Lightning as well, so spare points in Vigor will be hard to come by).  Mercenary[] Normal Act II Combat mercenary, which will provide its own Prayer for a mild boost of healing on top of your Meditation.  You could try a Nightmare Act II Offensive for some damage bonus, or a Nightmare Act II Defense to further reduce incoming damage rather than improve your healing. Try giving the mercenary some Damage Reduced By X circlets and armor as well; you could give it equipment you have replaced.  Getting 70 to 80 Damage Reduced By X will be possible if the mercenary helm and armor is similar to yours."},{"pageTitle":"Abd al-Hazir","pageContent":"Abd al-Hazir            Gender  Male     Occupation  Scholar, historian     Status  Alive     Appearances  Diablo III (mentioned only)Diablo III: Reaper of SoulsStorm of Light (mentioned only)Writings of Abd al-HazirThe Orphan and the Jeweler (mentioned only)   Abd al-Hazir is a renowned gentleman, historian, and scholar. Hailing from Caldeum, he traveled all over Sanctuary, writing many tomes on the lands and peoples he encountered in his journey. It was a journey that resulted in his capture and subsequent release.

I have since been told I was fortunate to escape so lightly.\"  - Abd al-Hazir(src)    At some point, al-Hazir visited Xiansai.[2] On his first day in the town of Zhou, he was robbed and left for dead, but managed to survive the experience.[3] During his travels through the nation he crossed paths with Franklin Burroughs, who would stay his friend. He would later recount his experiences in the Xiansai Chronicles.[2] On a separate occassion, al-Hazir visited the ruins of the temple city of Travincal. While exploring one of the long-abandoned temples, he was drawn by the flickering of faint torchlight through a distant doorway. As he crept nearer, he heard the sound of a voice, which he discovered belonged to an Archivist.[4]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Departure from Caldeum[]  \"Our list of ills seems never-ending: the state of our downtrodden and the slums they are forced to live in, our incompetent leadership, the reemergence of the intolerant Zakarum, and their quarrels with our mage class...I could go on for pages. It is all too much for one to bear, really.\"  - Abd al-Hazir(src)    A resident of Caldeum, al-Hazir was forced to look on as the city began its decline. In his mind, it began when nobles fleeing Kurast (the result of the carnage Mephisto unleashed) entered the city and demanded a place on its Trade Consortium Council. Caldeum's emperor was able to rectify the situation, but when the emperor became ill and his son took control of the throne, the decline continued.[5] Abd al-Hazir decided to leave the city and set out on a journey, to gather the world's knowledge together in one tome. While he was preparing, he received news that a Dune Thresher had killed a citizen just outside the city. Thus, he contacted his old friend Franklin Burroughs so that he could take part in his quest to rid Caldeum of the burrowing nightmare. Burroughs was reluctant at first, but al-Hazir could tell it was an act and soon, they headed out to find their foe.[2]  Encounter with Burrowing Death[]  \"You really want to feed some thresher, don't you, al-Hazir? What, haven't you seen scavengers before?\"  - Franklin Burroughs(src)    al-Hazir met Burroughs at dusk, at the sandy rocks that ringed that Tardin Wastes. There, Burroughs showed him the corpse of an unfortunate soul who had been attacked by a thresher, clinging to the rocks. It was a grisly sight[2] and he was treated to more unpleasantness, as Burroughs used scavengers to lure the thresher out. The thresher's maw closed around them, but they ended up eating it apart from the inside, killing the thresher, but they themselves dying due to its digestive juices. A delighted Burroughs engaged in a lecture about the properties of dune threshers while al-Hazir nodded weakly and wondered when he could head home and crawl into bed.[1]  Teganze[] al-Hazir headed east, entering the Torajan Jungles of Teganze. Translating ancient carvings, he learnt of the origins of the khazra[6] and came into contact with the Umbaru themselves. He interacted with the people of the Tribe of the Five Hills, who were currently engaged in a ritual war with the tribes of the Seven Stones and Shrouded Valley. He learnt what he could of his beliefs and their culture, but due to the social upheaval they were experiencing, he had to leave.[7]  New Tristram[]  \"We have all heard the tales associated with Tristram. The very mention of its name brings to mind images of undead monstrosities, demonic possession, monarchy driven to lunacy, and, of course, the greatest legend of all: the Lord of Terror unleashed. Although many now claim that a peculiar mold upon the bread or perhaps a fouling of the water drove the populace mad with visions, I have seen too much in my varied travels to dismiss such stories out of hand. It is within this context, then, that I have to say my journey to what is now called \"New Tristram\" was somewhat of a disappointment.\"  - Abd al-Hazir(src)    Heading west, al-Hazir entered Khanduras, arriving at the town of New Tristram. He had heard the tales of the Darkening of Tristram at the hand of Diablo, but found the settlement that had grown near the old town's ruins to be quite dreary. He explored the ruins of old Tristram, but could not bring himself to enter the town's cathedral.[8] He learnt what he could of the cathedral from an adventurer who had entered it two decades ago[9] Before leaving the town, he was confronted by Deckard Cain, who told him of the tomes that lay within the cathedral. al-Hazir decided to take his word for it, for he had no intention of entering the structure.[8]  The Festering Woods[] al-Hazir traveled to Wortham, hoping to find a guide to take him into the Festering Woods so he could observe the Gnarled Walkers that inhabited it. However, the few people he encountered in the town were unwilling to answer his inquiries. As he wandered throughout the town, he noticed that the bridge that led into the woods had been destroyed. It was another point the townsfolk refused to elaborate on. He found it odd that only elderly people seemed to inhabit the village, with the exception of a beautiful young girl, whose father insisted that al-Hazir stay away from. He introduced himself as Pablo DeSoto, and told al-Hazir of the Festering Woods and the rationale behind its namesake. He blamed the woods' dark nature on the Priests of Rathma, and expressed the belief that they had played a role in the Darkening of Tristram as well. Unsure about the truth of the matter, al-Hazir found himself greatful that he hadn't found a guide to take him into the woods—they seemed better suited to those of a more adventurous temprement.[10]  Bastion's Keep and Ivgorod[] al-Hazir traveled to Bastion's Keep. Standing on the ramparts, he had come to see the legendary Barbarians of the north, but only beheld the Arreat Crater. He wrote on what he knew of the Barbarians, of their vigil, and of the destruction of their home. He reflected that if any Barbarians still lived, they would be without hope.[11] By the time al-Hazir reached Ivgorod, winter was starting to come. Taking refuge in a tavern, he encountered a Monk. al-Hazir gingerly approached the man and was welcomed. Food was provided, but al-Hazir touched little of it, as he was more intent on learning what he could of the Monk's life. The man told him of the Sahptev faith and of his fighting style, claiming that his mind and body were the weapons he used. These were 'weapons' that the Monk put to good use against some thugs who entered the tavern. The Monk easily defeated them, and revealed one of their number as a demon before killing it.[12]  The Demon Hunters[] al-Hazir traveled to the edge of the Dreadlands. He later headed for the village of Bronn, but found that most of the buildings had been burnt to the ground, with bodies strewn everywhere. From the town's inn, gray-skinned creatures charged forth, intent on adding al-Hazir to their bodycount. Frozen in terror, al-Hazir let one of them grab him before he was saved by the Demon Hunter Valla. With her crossbows she laid waste to the demons. That night, she told al-Hazir about her life, how demons had laid waste to her village, and how she had survived and joined the Demon Hunters to take vengeance. Each and every Demon Hunter, she said, had a story like this.[13]  The Unburied[] al-Hazir returned to New Tristram. A few days out of town, he saw a falling star soaring across the sky. He could sense that something was wrong, and coming across a badly mangled traveler, his fears were confirmed. Before the man passed away, he referred to his killer as an \"Unburied,\" and how he and his fellow guardsmen had succeeded in felling the beast.[14]  Westmarch[] Note: The following events aren't necessarily in chronological order. Around this time, al-Hazir apparently entered Westmarch, with a temporary assistant. They encoutered various creatures on their travels. While searching for a Maggot Brood, they observed the corpse of one near the road to Westmarch. His new assistant vomited twice due to the smell, said vomit ending up on al-Hazir's traveling cloak. The stains came out eventually, but he was sorely vexed. [15] He had a low opinion of his assistant due to his incessant noise, and that was added to when they came across a Terror Bat. His assistant screamed loudly—enough to give al-Hazir a headache.[16] al-Hazir and his assistant took shelter in the caves outside Westmarch, with the intent of organizing al-Hazir's records. However, Vile Bats appeared and tore several of the scrolls to pieces, much to al-Hazir's lament.[17] al-Hazir planned to explore the Ruins of Corvus, but then discovered they were filled with Scarabs. Of course, he claimed, such creatures didn't frighten him, but they made his research too time consuming.[18]  The Coven[]  \"I knew the cultists had found me when I saw the bloody, curved knife stabbed violently into my door this morning. I have spent months trying to ease the fevered imaginings that have tormented me since that encounter a scant few months past, but to no avail. And now they know who I am.\"  - Abd al-Hazir(src)    Back in Khanduras, al-Hazir traveled through a forest near Tristram. Finding the darkness of the night oppressive, he saw a fire crackling in the gloom. Heading towards the source of the light, he felt a sense of overwhelming dread, and heard the sound of chanting. Checking himself, he didn't head straight towards the fire, but instead sought a vantage point to observe the proceedings. Before him was a collection of cultists, arrayed in a circle. While he had heard of these cultists before, this was the first time he had seen them himself. As he watched them chant on, he thought to leave, but then saw a pale supplicant being drawn forward, and was compelled to stay and watch. The supplicant knelt in the center, and the cultists' leader stepped forward, before drawing out a spike that he rammed into the supplicant's back. al-Hazir almost screamed, but the supplicant made no sound. As the leader readied another spike, al-Hazir couldn't stand it any longer. He broke into a run, running as hard as he could, as long as he could, until he could do no so longer. As soon as he was able, he staggered to his feet, and ran some more. Returning home, al-Hazir began to research the cultists in an effort to ease his mind, to assure him that what he had seen hadn't actually happened. And yet, every whispered, frightened tale served to confirm his fears. Then, one morning, he saw a bloody, curved knife stabbed into his door. He had been marked.[19]  The Ruins of Sescheron[]  \"Greetings! I am Abd al-Hazir, you may have heard of me? And my disappearance? No? Well, I was captured months ago by the Coven in retaliation for secretly observing one of their rituals. But you, sir/madam, have secured your place in the history books by rescuing me, I can assure you. No, no, no—no thanks are necessary.\"  - al-Hazir, after being rescued by the Nephalem(src)    Shortly after Malthael's defeat, late in the year,[19] al-Hazir was abducted by the Coven: they discovered him observing their rituals. He even befriended one of the cultists, Kalvesan, by constantly pleading for his life, and eventually escaped, his friend sacrificing himself to buy al-Hazir time to flee to safety. The freedom was very brief, though, as soon afterwards, al-Hazir has been recaptured by Ice Clan khazra. He was thus imprisoned in Sescheron. However, he was rescued by the Nephalem and taken to Bastion's Keep, promising to write books about the heroes to return the favor.[20]  In-game[]          al-Hazir and his cage as seen in game    Numerous logs from al-Hazir can be found throughout Diablo III and Reaper of Souls. Most beastiary, history and location entries are narrated by him. As of patch 2.3.0, al-Hazir appears in the game's Adventure Mode, and can be found in Ruins of Sescheron in Act III. His rescue is the goal of the The Return of Abd al-Hazir event. Once rescued, he will accompany the Nephalem for the rest of their exploration of Sescheron, commenting on Barbarian history, Kanai's fate and some other issues. He cannot be killed, and does not attack. Upon returning to the Keep, he leaves and is on his way.  Quotes[] Skular's replies included where possible —Your civilization was much nobler than most people realized.—Do not tell me about my own people.—People once thought of the barbarians as savages, but their civilization was actually based on honor and nobility. —Your people's belief that they must be buried on Arreat to find peace has sentenced your dead to eternal wandering.—Shall we see what happens to your kind after they die? —The Khazra are insidious trap makers.—They will soon be dead trap makers. —These cannibals are obviously driven by black acrimonious humours.—No. They have fallen to dark magics. There is no other way.—Humours.—Dark magics. —Demons! Kill them!! Kill them!!!—Feel free to just stand around screaming. I managed to befriend one of my captors, Kalvesan, by constantly acting the fool and pleading for my life. Then, we were set upon. Kalvesan, bless him, freed me before confronting the attackers. I quickly took advantage of his heroic sacrifice and made my escape. As he screamed his last, I swore his death would not be in vain. Sadly, I was soon captured by the Khazra and was unable to avenge him. I am not accustomed to standing around; I'm a man of action! Greetings! I am Abd al-Hazir, you may have heard of me? And my disappearance? No? Well, I was captured months ago by the Coven in retaliation for secretly observing one of their rituals. But you, sir/madam, have secured your place in the history books by rescuing me, I can assure you. No, no, no—no thanks are necessary. Have you heard of the great barbarian elder Kanai? Silly me, of course you have, he was your people's best hope for the future; and the final one, as it turns out. It is strange they have placed Kanai's corpse on the Immortal Throne, as he died before he could be crowned king. Safety at last! You have not only my eternal thanks, but also the thanks of the world at large for rescuing me. You seem quite intelligent, especially for a barbarian. (to Barbarian) You gained quite a reputation from your youth in Caldeum! You don't seem half as bad as they say. (to Wizard) You are an impressive warrior, despite your rudimentary beliefs. An unseen land filled with spirits? How droll! (to Witch Doctor) You are an impressive warrior, despite your rudimentary beliefs. It must be difficult keeping all those gods straight. (to Monk) You are so dedicated! You cling to the idea that you can rid the world of demons, when it is demonstrably untrue! (to Demon Hunter) It impresses me that someone with your intelligence continues to adhere to their religion when it has been so thoroughly discredited. (to Crusader) I thought lying in wait for cannibals for 20 years was tedious. Then I met you. (after meeting Skular, to Barbarian) You know, people have compared me to the great historians and philosophers – Brast, Lysra, Jeram, Valthek. Humility prevents me from commenting on such things, of course. —Ahhh, Sescheron, the once grand capital of the whole of your civilization. Every stone exudes memories of its violent fall.—You talk of things you don't understand.—I beg to differ. I was held against my will for months. I now know what hell truly is. Spikes? Not a very welcoming place, is it? Khazra. Pfft. Lice ridden mongrels. They steal human babies. You don't want to know what they do with them. What? Spirits? That's... that's unfair! We killed them already! These beasts are so retched even death doesn't want them. (The Three Guardians) Yes, yes, very good. I of course spotted this[hidden alcove] immediately; I was interested to see if you would find it as well. I believe thanks are in order, as we just rescued you, though I am surprised barbarians could be caught so easily by common Khazra. (upon rescuing Skular) Personality and Traits[] Judging by his journal entries, al-Hazir was often quite dismissive of the more supernatural and spectacular aspects of Sanctuary and the Burning Hells, often dismissing tales of demons and monsters as fabrications and/or exaggerations.[21] However, some threats he treated with due credit, such as the undead[22] and that of uncontrolled use of magic.[23] Abd al-Hazir has been repeatedly compared to famous historians and philosophers such as Brast, Lysra, Jeram or Valthek by his readers, yet he himself (as he said, out of modesty, humility and honesty) rejected such comparison.[24] al-Hazir was accompanied by a number of assistants over his travels. In his mind, he paid them quite generously.[25]  Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.  Abd al-Hazir's name is a possible reference to Abdul Alhazred from the Cthulhu Mythos. Both devote their lives studying the unseen forces at work in their respective worlds. In fact, Abd al-Hazir is a more correct transliteration of the \"Abd Al-Azrad\" than the original. In Arabic, Abd al-Hazir roughly translates at \"servant of the Omnipresent\" or \"servant of the Great presence\". al-Hazir's view on the Burning Hells seems to differ in two journal entries.

The main difference that separates the Abominable from the Wendigo is the temperature it can survive in, and prefers cold climates. None have ever spotted an Abominable in an area where the temperature wasn't below freezing. The Abominable were previously known to coexist peacefully with humans, avoiding contact whenever possible. However, chaos tainted them, as they are now quick to anger and attack with huge, sweeping blows of their massive claws. Once provoked, they do not relent until their opponent is slain or they themselves have fallen.[1]  In-game[] All Abominable types are found in the Act V of Diablo II.  They are much like the normal Wendigo with a speed increase when damaged, however the difference in Abominables is that they are all Cold based and so possess big resistances to it along with the first two variants having an ability to inflict Cold damage on higher difficulties.

Diablo II[] In Diablo II, damage absorption usually works on a damage of a specific type, as well as heals the user that amount of damage before they take damage from the rest of the hit. There are two types of absorption modifiers: one that reduces damage by a specific number of hit points (e.g., \"+15 Fire Absorb\" on Hellmouth), and one that reduces damage by a specific percentage (e.g., \"Cold Absorb 20%\", as found on Raven Frost). The value of absorption modifiers varies greatly due to how damage is inflicted: Absorbing lightning damage is the most useful since lightning tends to hit in multiple small bolts. Ten points of lightning absorb can completely neutralize a Lightning Enchanted boss, if it's emitting dozens of 6-8 damage charges. In contrast, ten points of fire absorb, even after healing, would make hardly any difference against a 500 damage Meteor. Absorb Magic Damage modifiers work against all types of non-physical damage. Absorb Damage modifiers are very useful against elemental attacks, especially multiple small damage hits, such as those from Council Members' Hydras or Scarab Demons. Absorb X% Damage modifiers are most useful against fierce elemental damage monsters.        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Calculating Absorption[] Absorption is calculated as follows:  For elemental damage, calculate resistance first. Remove percentage absorption, if any. Remove hit point absorption, if any. Add healing, up to maximum hit points. Example: A player with Raven Frost and 75% Cold Resistance takes 400 hit points of cold damage. The 75% resistance takes the damage down to 100 HP. The Cold Absorb takes 20% of that figure off, leaving 80 HP, and then those 20 HP are converted to healing, leaving a final damage of just 60 HP. As a result of the formula, the effective damage reduction from Absorb is twice the listed amount: Raven Frost, for example, reduces cold damage by 40 percent. The maximum effective percentage absorb that has any effect is 40%.     Special Modifiers    Absorption Blinds Target Cannot Be Frozen Crushing Blow Deadly Strike Demon Heal Defense vs. Missiles Faster Cast Rate Faster Hit Recovery Faster Run/Walk Freezes Target Ignores Target's Defense Increased Attack Speed Increased Blocking Speed Knockback Open Wounds Piercing Prevents Monster Heal Slain Monsters Rest in Peace Slows Target     Diablo III[] Absorption returns in Diablo III, but works in a slightly different way, absorbing damage like Mana Shield in Diablo I, except that it consumes the shield's own capacity rather than Mana. Some skills protect the character (or their ally) with a shield of force, barrier of pure diamond or a shroud of holy energy, making enemy damaging attacks drain from the shield instead of the victim's Life pool. Shield fully benefits from all types of protection, so the exact same amount that would otherwise go to unsaved damage depletes the shield potency. If the shield cannot ward off all damage, it disappears, making the remaining amount be drained from the character's Life as normal. Note that absorption, unlike complete immunity, does not protect from secondary effects of an attack; that is, all effects other than damage will apply as normal. Moreover, for all effects that trigger on a damaging hit, even a fully absorbed attack still counts as taking or inflicting unsaved damage. Even Life Steal and other similar effects (what few remain in game) work on absorbed damage. Due to the amounts of damage skills and effects can absorb being limited, absorption builds benefit greatly from increased armor and resistances. Some skills calculate the amount of damage absorbed based on the character's maximum Life, while other use fixed amount (but tend to increase its effectiveness from innate healing attributes). A number of skills exist (such as Ignore Pain) that also decrease the unsaved damage by percentage, regardless of how high it is. These skills take effect before absorption, so combining both may greatly reduce the total amount of damage taken."},{"pageTitle":"Absorption (magic suffix)","pageContent":"Absorption is a suffix that can appear on Magic and Rare Items.

When they notice a foe, they conjure a water elemental (resembling Hydra) at the location of their choice for 6-10 seconds. The elemental is immobile and must be constantly supported by a Caller (who cannot perform any other actions while channelling, stopping the casting will destroy the elemental).

Contents  1 Lore 2 Gameplay  2.1 PvE 2.2 PvP   3 List of Towers 4 References    Lore[] The Accursed Towers date back to Sanctuary's ancient past. In 1270, they were unearthed, each exuding an aura of power.[1] One of these towers was unearthed on an island in the Gulf of Westmarch. As artifacts were uncovered and returned to Westmarch, whispers of nightmares started to spread, and a request was made for more workers. The dig advanced ahead of schedule, but rumors of nightmares and hallucinations grew among the workers. The dig quickly became a test of wills, one that the workers 'won,' in a sense, as the tower stood revealed. However, claims spread of workers returning with their minds torn.[2]           The Immortals and Shadows fight for control of the towers    The tower in the Gulf was not the only tower that stood revealed. Sanctuary's denizens desired to claim the powers for themselves, but did not know how to do so. The Immortals and Shadows were among the factions that fought for control of the towers, and Hell also sought to control them.[1]  Gameplay[]          Accursed Towers interface    Accursed Towers is features both PvE and PvP gameplay. Clans will compete to claim ownership of towers, thereby providing powerful bonuses to all clan members and the opportunity to acquire new cursed items. Players must be in a clan to participate in the mode. Each clan may have up to 2 towers under their control per season. At the end of each eight-week season, the ownership of all towers is reset. At the start of a season, players will see many towers on the map to select from, all of which will be Unclaimed Towers. During the first week of a season, from Monday, 3 a.m.–Saturday 7 p.m. server time, the clans leader can select a tower through the Accursed Towers menu and attempt to claim it for the clan, plunging the Clan into a PvE match against Hell’s minions for control of the tower by purifying it. Only 1 tower can be claimed per clan during the first week of the season.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     PvE[] While fighting demonic hordes for control of the tower, a clan’s objective is to collect Cursed Shards from slain demons. However, players can’t simply attack enemies as they normally would. To deal damage to their foes, players need to locate and activate the tower’s Curse Sources. Doing so will make enemies vulnerable, allowing players to dispatch them and collect their Cursed Shards. Once the timer runs out, the top 10 clan members with the highest Cursed Shard amounts will have them added to their team’s total. A clan can choose to do as many runs to collect Cursed Shards at the same tower as they desire, but only the highest team total will be retained. If a clan has collected the most Cursed Shards among all clans vying for that specific tower by Saturday at 7 p.m. server time, then their clan will claim the tower. Even after taking the tower, Hell will attempt to retake it. Once the Corruption meter reaches a certain amount, demonic incursions will follow. Members of the clan must come to defend their tower promptly or else it will be lost and can be reclaimed by another clan. The demons can be warded off by powering up the tower. Within the Accursed Tower's menu, the clan leader can choose to power up their tower. Doing so will not only end the attacks on it from demons but increase the bonuses provided by your tower and periodic rewards provided by the rewards chest inside of it. However, if the tower is powered up, other clans will be able to challenge the owning clan for control of the tower through PvP.[1]   PvP[] Starting the second week of a season, clans can have a second tower under their control. From Saturday, 9 p.m.–Sunday 12 a.m. server time, clans will be able to attempt to challenge for tower ownership from another clan through an all-out PvP match. The clan who wins, in addition to gaining control of the tower, also receives a number of rewards from the match, which can included cursed items.[1]   List of Towers[] Tower of Blessings Tower of Conquest Tower of Punishment Tower of Technique Tower of Wisdom  This section is a stub.

Cooperative Achievements are similar to general and campaign achievements. They are split into subgroups by act, but pertain to tasks completed while playing public games. The player is rewarded for actions such as reviving a set amount of allies, and completing events in a group. Hardcore Achievements are rewarded for leveling a character in Hardcore Mode. There are also achievements for killing bosses and subbosses on the different difficulties. Torment Achievements are rewarded for leveling a character in Torment Mode. There are also achievements for killing bosses and subbosses on the different difficulties. Classes Achievements are rewarded for completing challenges specific to each class.

He is the best hunter in Seram and a good friend of Uldyssian. Naturally gifted with a bow and arrow, Achilios journeys with Uldyssian, Mendeln and Serenthia in their quest to stop the manipulating influence of both the Cathedral of Light and the Triune.  Background[] Achilios was a blond and wiry figure, nearly as tall as Uldyssian. He was usually dressed in his hunter's clothing - a brown and green outfit consisting of a jerkin and pants that allowed him to blend into the surroundings of Seram. He had soft leather boots designed for padding silently through the woods. His swift frame hinted of his swiftness but belied his strength: the great bow that was Achilios' pride and joy required great strength to string. His skill in both archery and hunting was unmatched in the region.[1] He was a handsome man, and he was deeply in love with Serenthia. Sadly for him she had feelings for Uldyssian, but this did not deter him. Achilios came across a strange object in the middle of the woods, roughly at the same time of the mysterious events in Seram. Together with Mendeln they went to investigate. Upon touching the stone surface, Achilios felt an emptiness, reminding him of death. Achilios later joined Uldyssian in his quest to bring down the Triune and the Cathedral of Light. His tracking skills proved a great asset in their travels, and his skill with the bow proved equally useful. During their stay in Partha, Achilios befriended the boy Cedric. When the evil priest Malic, disguised as Master Ethon, enchanted his bow to miss, Achilios' extraordinary skill still allowed him to hit his targets. It was also after the party left Partha that Serenthia finally answered his love. However, during the showdown with Lucion, Achilios was mortally wounded with one of his own arrows. Unable to help him, the hunter almost instantly dies. His body was buried in the wilderness.

Despite his current plight he vowed to protect Serenthia from any harm. Though Achilios was bound and animated by spells, he still had a high degree of free will. Achilios insisted in eliminating assassins sent by the Triune, and helped expel Lilith's spirit from Serenthia's body. Achilios also has an encounter with Tyrael, who imbues him with holy power and 'overwrites' his orders: Achilios is forced to attack his own friends. His strong, independent character allows him to rebel against Tyrael's orders, however. Achilios continues helping his friends, standing side-by-side with his love Serenthia at the Battle of the Golden Path. After Uldyssian sacrificed himself in order to save Sanctuary, Achilios was returned to life.    This article is a stub. You can help the Diablo Wiki to become more awesome by  expanding it.

Another area in Act II is a place called Alcarnus. Mentioned during the Monk's cinematic, it is a city that has been overrun with demons and cultists. Players will get a chance to go to Alcarnus as seen in a gameplay video.  BlizzCon 2011[] During the Diablo Lore panel at BlizzCon 2011, Three new areas were shown from Act II. All three of these areas are playable and play an important part in telling the story as we progress through this Act. Caldeum - Caldeum was the jewel of the East. It became the trading center for all of Sanctuary. However, there was turmoil due to the Zakarum, rich merchants, and Wizards all vying for power over the city. Hakan eventually took rule and united the three groups to create the most prosperous city. However, his death left a son too young to rule the city. The Iron Wolves, lead by Asheara from Diablo II, were hired to protect him until he was old enough to rule the city. However, Hakan II removed them and replaced them with his own Caldeum guards. Asheara is unsure of why he made this decision and now helps the people on the lower parts of Caledum. Dahlgur Oasis - This small paradise was the birth of Caldeum. A mysterious man rose from the waste and showed the original settlers this source of water which was used to help begin Caldeum. However, the story is said that this mysterious man disappeared back into the waste after showing them. The Archives of Zoltun Kulle - Zoltun Kulle was one of the original members of the Horadrim who helped capture the Great Evils the first time. However, he eventually became corrupt and evil. He was so strong that the Horadrim could not kill him, so they removed his head and buried it underground surrounded by magical runes. His body has been sent into another dimension.  BlizzCon 2009 Demo[] In the BlizzCon 2009 Demo, players start in an area called Sundered Pass, and is tasked by the woman called Asheara to reach the town called Alcarnus, which has apparently been desecrated by the Cultists. The player then sets off through several areas, of which some are the Stinging Winds and the Canyon Rim Mines. Some new monsters were revealed, like the Desert Dervish and the Desert Wasp. At the end of the Monk Reveal Trailer, the hero fought against a Morlu Caster, but this enemy did not appear in the demo.

BlizzCon 2015 presentation    Action Combat is a gameplay feature in Diablo III, aimed to make the combat more dynamic and give players a reason to battle at faster pace, using their surroundings. Originally, it was exclusive to the Reaper of Souls console version of the game, but as of patch 2.4, it was added to PC and Mac as well. It is available to all players, regardless of whether they have Reaper of Souls or not.    Contents  1 In-game 2 Kill Streak (Massacre) 3 Destruction (\"Crushed\") 4 Environment Kills (Traps)    In-game[] Action Combat gives players various bonuses for meeting special criteria in battle. All of them are displayed graphically mid-screen.  Killing Streaks (multiple kills within short time, 15+ foes) increase experience gained from these kills once the streak is over. The more enemies killed at once, the larger this bonus will be. All experience from kills made during the streak will be accounted. Example: killing 30 enemies that each award 100 XP will grant double experience, to a total of 2 x (30 x 100) = 6,000, while killing them normally would award 3,000. The timer refreshes every time any damage is done to an enemy, displayed as a burning fuse. Object Destruction Streaks (destroying breakable objects) will grant a 30% increased movement speed bonus (not multiplicative). The more objects are destroyed at once, the longer this bonus will last. Environment Kill Streaks (killing monsters with traps and destructibles) will grant double primary resource gain, multiplicative to other similar effects. The more enemies are killed by environment, the longer this bonus will last.

Scoring a Massacre will provide an experience bonus, as stated above. The more you kill, the higher your bonus will be. Each tier of Massacre has a title, which will show in its cue card when you hit the limit, and after the Massacre ends. Here are some of the names and limits needed to get a multiplier:  10 kills, Massacre: 1.5x 20 kills, Vengeful Massacre: 1.75x 30 kills, Dominant Massacre: 2x 40 kills, Crushing Massacre: 2.25x 50 kills, Brutal Massacre: 2.5x 75 kills, Savage Massacre: 2.75x 100 kills, Ruthless Massacre: 3x 150 kills, Vicious Massacre: 3.25x 200 kills, Bloodthirsty Massacre: 3.5x 400 kills, Diabolical Massacre: 4x Destruction (\"Crushed\")[] Destruction bonus starts at 7 objects destroyed. As soon as the 7th object breaks, you're awarded the \"Dimensional Speed\" Buff, which will start ticking down, unless you've \"crushed\" more objects. \"Crushing\" more objects will add onto the timer, but only to a limit. For a 7 streak, another one with 10 seconds remaining will only add the missing time. Sometimes it's hard to know how many you've \"crushed\" due to Massacre's callout taking priority. Timer caps out at 1 minute, but you can keep it there longer with more \"crushes\" in a row.  Environment Kills (Traps)[] Trapping a foe means to use the environment as a weapon. Usually a wall propped up by some wood or a wire rack full of hot coals, but explosive barrels and any other traps will work too. As stated above, you gain double resource charge called \"Trap Mastery\". The time rates seems to depend on the type of monster killed, varying from 30s to almost 1 minute.  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/c9/Action-combat-1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20160128163646\" title=\"Action-combat-1.jpg (34 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Action-combat-1\" data-image-name=\"Action-combat-1.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Action-combat-1.jpg\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/5/5d/Action-combat-2jpg.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20160128163655\" title=\"Action-combat-2jpg.jpg (29 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Action-combat-2jpg\" data-image-name=\"Action-combat-2jpg.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Action-combat-2jpg.jpg\">"},{"pageTitle":"Acts","pageContent":"Acts are a gameplay feature of Diablo II, III, and IV.

In her later years, she would tell the children of the village tales of the deeds of the Horadrim, in their quest to imprison the Prime Evils. She would tell the same stories more than once, and they became more extravagant each time. In 1213, events came to a head as sickness took her husband. By this stage, Deckard had lost interest in his mother's stories, believing them to have no basis in reality despite her insistence to the contrary. It was only made worse when Deckard discovered that his mother had burnt his history books, Aderes insisting that his \"proper reading\" was with the texts written by his ancestor. It was the straw that broke Deckard's back, and Aderes's too, as she declared her son lost.[1]  References[]  ↑ The Order             GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021"},{"pageTitle":"Adiya","pageContent":"\"She is no god. This is a demon.\"  - A spirit telling Benu about Adiya(src)      Adiya    Gender  Female     Race  Demon     Status  Deceased     Appearances  Doubtwalker    Adiya was a demon. She had the ability to take on human form while hiding her true nature. Her real form was a torso carried upon limbs of tentacles, each of them covered in hundreds of mouths. Three horns portruded through the top of her head, and in lieu of a jaw, a gaping orifice pulsed at the bottom of her head.  Biography[] Disguising herself as an Umbaru female who was supposedly the wife of Guwate'ka, Adiya revealed herself to Benu, a Witch Doctor. She had sensed his doubt and had been drawn into the jungle. On the day before an Igani Bawe, she told him that the spirits of the Unformed Land were uneasy. That they said that there was nothing in the Umbaru that was unique or worth celebrating. That the Umbaru were blind. She further claimed that the high priests were using the Igani Bawe as a means of controlling Umbaru society. Benu was uneasy, but did admit that he had seen things in the Unformed Land that had made him question his dedication to the Igani. Adiya told him that she had come to Benu in the hope that he might change the Umbaru's ways. The following day, Adiya came to Benu during the Harvest of Souls, despite being forbidden from being there as she was not a Witch Doctor. Having seen the results of the Harvest, he came to accept her claims as being true. However, they were captured by Tribe of the Clouded Valley Witch Doctors. Both of them were led to the tribe's home village where they were to be sacrificed. Adiya mentioned that the Umbaru were forbidden from carrying out cannibalism—a great sin in Umbaru society, for one who did so would become kareeb; damned by the spirits. She claimed that these were stories crafted by the high priests, and that her husband had heard stories of eating Witch Doctor flesh being a path to godhood. With this power, they could reform Umbaru culture. In truth, she sought to torment Benu, as he would be so distraught by his actions, she would be able to feast on his spirit years later. Whatever the case, when the tribesmen came to take them to be sacrificed, Adiya killed them and led Benu out of the hut. The Clouded Valley tribesmen were stunned, as this was far from normal behaviour in an Igani Bawe, where captives were honoured to be sacrificed. She bit into a captive's heart and bristled with power. She bid that Benu do the same. However, he refused, causing Adiya to lash out at him, calling him a coward. She shot bolts of energy into Benu, temporarily incapacitating him. She then turned her attention to the Clouded Valley tribesmen, killing scores of them and devastating their village. Benu got to his feet and battled her, and while he was able to kill Adiya, the wounds she inflicted on him ensured that he died himself moments later.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     References[]  ↑ Doubtwalker"},{"pageTitle":"Adleric Nahr","pageContent":"\"As a young man, my own uncle, Adleric, was part of the forces of Westmarch that fought against King Leoric's army, when the king went mad.

Two guards succumbed to the inferno, the Light-forsaken heat roasting them in their armor. Water had no noticeable effect on the flames at first. It took a full day to extinguish the blaze.\"  - An excerpt from one of the reports made on Adria's fire(src)   Adria was born in Kingsport[1] in the 1220s[2] as the daughter of a merchant named Sevrin.[1] From a young age, she resented her father, seeing him as more interested in his wealth and possessions than his own flesh and blood. Adria saw a witch for the first time when her father took her to the town square to see the public execution of one. He told her to look at the woman, at what he called \"the face of evil.\" But when Adria looked, the witch looked like any normal person. And when the fire was lit, she burnt like any normal person. As the flames consumed her, the witch met Adria's eyes...and laughed.[3] Before Adria's tenth year, Sevrin lost a small fortune when his ships were destroyed in a storm, and in a fit of drunken rage, killed Adria's mother. Sevrin was arrested by the city guards, but due to his wealth and influence, was able to secure a pardon. During this time, Adria lingered outside the jailhouse. When Sevrin was released, the two went back to living at their dockside abode. Not long after these events, Sevrin's home caught fire in the dead of night. Standing outside,[1] Adria heard his screams and could smell his burning flesh, later describing it as \"sickly sweet.\" Adria later reflected that it was only in his last moments that her father truly saw her, and only in those last moments did he understand what she was.[3] Afterward, Adria vanished into the night. Deckard Cain would later speculate that Adria had played a role in the blaze.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     After Kingsport[] After these events, it appears that Adria fled to the wilderness around Kingsport, and perhaps as far north as Westmarch.[1] Adria was labeled as a witch by those she encountered, but found that morality was flexible. When a daughter had a child that needed to disappear, when a sickness needed to be cured, it was her that they turned to.[3] At some point, she spotted a Treasure Goblin. She spent weeks tracking down the creature until she realized the truth of their activities, and the demon that they served. Thus, she gave up on that endeavor.[4]  The Coven[]  \"Adria and Maghda. Two as one. Bound together as the Lesser Evils Duriel and Andariel are. They gave our lives meaning, and in return asked only for devotion. There was nothing we would not do for them. Nothing they would not do for one another.\"  - The writing of one of the Coven's former members.(src)            Adria and Maghda    Eventually, Adria became involved with a small and secretive group of witches that existed in the Westmarch's remote wilds. Over the years, she became a powerful figure within the circle. It was here that she met another witch, Maghda. The two became close, sharing certain traits in an uncanny manner.[1] One of her first tasks was to search for the resting place of Baal. She learnt that the Lord of Destruction's spirit was contained in the body of Tal Rasha, and that he in turn was entombed deep beneath the deserts of Aranoch. She was able to find his tomb, but could not learn how to enter the final chamber. However, whispers in her dreams explained that she had done well in failure, that if she had found Baal, he would have likely killed her where she stood.[4] At some point, Maghda convinced Adria to poison the leaders of the Coven so they could take control.[5] The cult had been floundering prior to their arrival, but when they took control and poisoned its leaders, they reforged it into a dangerous new order that practiced torture and demonic summoning. It is said that these witches were fueled by the belief that they were destined to become mortal heralds of the Burning Hells.[1] While in the Coven, Adria compiled a tome collecting all she had learned over her travels, so that the Coven might turn this knowledge to its advantage. She declared that the final war between Heaven and Hell was coming and that demon lords had whispered to her, telling her of two possible outcomes. In one, Hell recognised the worth of the Coven and they ruled alongside them. In the other, they saw the Coven as being less than useless, their souls tormented for eternity. She urged the Coven to look at sources of power beyond demonology, from the Mage Clans, to even Zakarum itself. While these groups were not servants of Hell, she insisted that the only pertinent question was whether they were powerful.[4] Years after taking control of the Coven,[1] Adria and Maghda had a falling out[6] and Adria left the group,[5] around the time of the Darkening of Tristram.[1] Cain would later speculate that while Maghda had been devoted to the cult, Adria had only been 'passing through,' that she was driven by the allure of power rather than any greater affiliation.[1] Adria would later write that Maghda had become too complacent, having a far greater estimation of the position of the Coven than Adria did. When she heard the call of Diablo and left the Coven, she did not feel any sorrow in leaving, but rather, that a burden had been lifted from her shoulders.[4]  The Darkening of Tristram[]  \"Why don't that old crone do somethin' for a change. Sure, sure, she's got stuff, but you listen to me... she's unnatural. I ain't never seen her eat or drink - and you can't trust somebody who doesn't drink at least a little.\"  - Farnham, on Adria(src)            Adria    Not long afterward[6], with the appearance of the Hellmouth at Tristram, Adria saw an opportunity to both strike a blow against the legions of Hell, and to make some profit in gold and magical artifacts in the process.[2] Thus, Adria arrived in the village while most of its people were fleeing, and constructed a small hut on the edge of the village, seemingly overnight.[1] Many of the remaining villagers were wary of her, both in regards to her skill in magic, and her procurement of magical items.[7] One of Asylla's handmaidens called her a witch, and told Adria that she had no virtue in her soul.[4] Adria made no secret of being a witch,[8] and Deckard Cain was one of the few individuals to interact with her.[9] The pair spent many nights in the Tavern of the Rising Sun, discussing Horadric texts and the various arcana Adria had collected during her travels.[10] Cain found her knowledge about mysticism and demonology most valuable, though he did find her behavior peculiar at times.[9] It was during these conversations that Cain mentioned the Black Soulstone, something that Adria thought little of at the time, but would later come to realize its true significance.[11] When Cain asked about Adria's past, she only said that her father had been a merchant, and otherwise ignored or deflected subsequent questions.[1] As adventurers came to Tristram, they found Adria's magical trade indispensable.[2] Not that this prevented them from meeting their demise in the depths of the cathedral.[12] Eventually though, three adventurers succeeded where others have failed. Aidan, accompanied by a rogue and sorcerer, journeyed into the depths of the Cathedral and found the source of its corruption—Diablo, Lord of Terror. Aidan slew the demon, but was left psychologically and physically scarred by the experience. Tormented by his experiences, Aidan sought solace with Adria.[9]           A sketch of Adria by Deckard Cain    Aidan had plunged Diablo's soulstone into his forehead in an attempt to contain Diablo's essence,[9] and Adria beheld that essence within him.[5] When Aidan spoke, she heard thousands of voices, and saw the flames of her past. Adria knew fear.[3] She suspected that he had summoned her as a proof against possible failure; at the very least, he had not corrupted her like he had Aidan. He whispered to her of the End of Days, and pronounced her worthy to serve him in his ultimate victory. He gave her dreams of decay and corruption, knowing that she would see them as the natural end of humanity.[4] She pledged herself to Diablo's service.[5] She would give Diablo her blood and soul, and he would give her the destiny she knew to be hers by right. She marked his soul as he caressed her, in preparation for a plan that would take over 20 years to come to fruition.[4] Adria and Aidan spent many nights behind closed doors,[9] and through this liaison, Adria became pregnant with Aidan/Diablo's daughter, Leah. It would take time, but it was intended that when the time was right, Leah would serve as Diablo's vessel as part of his plan to become the sole Prime Evil.[5] Because the ritual had been conducted with Adria's own blood, Diablo had an affinity for it, and therefore, the child they had conceived. However, Adria had to find a means to contain the essences of the other Great Evils.[4]  Departure[]  \"Aidan came to me last night. I suspected what was lurking within his troubled heart. I consoled him as best I could. Regardless, wherever he's headed, Hell will surely follow in his wake. The shadows close in on Tristram once again. But, like Aidan, I'll be gone before they fall.\"  - Adria in her journal(src)     <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/92/Adria-tree2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131015070825\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Adria-tree2\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/92/Adria-tree2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20131015070825\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"317\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Adria-tree2.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Adria-tree2.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/92/Adria-tree2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20131015070825\"></a>       Adria    Eventually, Aidan left Tristram, now wearing the guise of the Dark Wanderer. Adria told Cain that he had headed east to find mystics that could help exorcise his nightmares. Shortly afterwards, Adria departed also, along with Gillian. The pair traveled to Caldeum where Adria gave birth to Leah.[13] Adria bore no love for the girl, seeing her as Diablo's daughter rather than hers, and a tool at that. After all, she reflected, daughters were a cheap thing.[3] The infant was left in Gillian's care, and after casting a protective spell around Gillian's new home,[13] Adria departed[9] on a mysterious errand.[1] At some point during his travels, with a new group of heroes in pursuit of the Dark Wanderer, Cain encountered Adria and learned of Leah's existence. He promised her that he'd keep her safe. She gave the scholar a scroll of misdirection and protection in the event that he and Leah would have to evade prying eyes.[13] Adria was present at Mount Arreat when Baal led his armies against the Barbarians. She witnessed as his Oppressors tore through the Barbarian ranks. When Baal corrupted the Worldstone, Adria sensed the darkness he had infected it with. In this moment, she realized what the Worldstone was, and what it could truly do, that the stories of how it had forged Sanctuary were true. She was able to survive the Worldstone's destruction and the ensuring fallout.[4]  Post-Arreat[]   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/bd/429px-Adria.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081105145439\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"429px-Adria\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/bd/429px-Adria.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20081105145439\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"252\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"429px-Adria.jpg\" data-image-key=\"429px-Adria.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/bd/429px-Adria.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20081105145439\"></a>       Adria    Over the intervening years, Adria and Cain's paths occassionally crossed, but they never met face to face. Adria caught a few glimpses of her daughter, but otherwise remained inconspicuous.[10] Seven years after the destruction of the Worldstone and Mount Arreat, Cain heard a report that Adria had perished in the Dreadlands.[13] Whatever truth may have existed in the report, it was inaccurate in that Adria was indeed still alive.[11] The destruction of Mount Arreat was the culmination of a series of events that had left five of the Great Evils dead, making Belial and Azmodan the last two lords of Hell.[9] After visiting an Entsteig sanitarium (where he learnt of Adria's past affiliation with the Coven), Cain began to sense Adria's presence nearby. Still, the witch managed to evade his attempts to track her down. At some point around this time, Adria passed through the Great Library of Caldeum, where she had come searching for information concerning the battles of the Sin War and Mage Clan Wars. Specifically, she was interested in the Desolate Sands and the ruins of the Cathedral of Light. These were places that Zoltun Kulle had once visited. Cain realized that she was searching for information on the Black Soulstone.[1]  The Black Soulstone[]  \"I have been dreaming of the soulstone. Every night. Not as it is, but as it will be. Trembling with the spirits of the Prime and Lesser Evils who scream from their prison. They shake with rage when they realize what Diablo is planning. But it is too late. Far too late. Before they can act, the spirits are channeled into the vessel. My master consumes them all. Becomes them all. Mortal flesh burns away to reveal his greatest form. The Prime Evil. I can make this dream a reality. With Kulle's spells to mark the souls of the Evils, and the Black Soulstone to contain them, I can bring this vision to life.\"  - Adria(src)    The essences of the Great Evils bar Belial and Azmodan lingered on Sanctuary. At some point, Adria learnt of Zoltun Kulle and his creation of the Black Soulstone. She realized that this was the means through which Diablo's vision of becoming a singular Prime Evil could be realized, by 'marking' the souls of the Great Evils for absorption into the stone. To test Kulle's spellwork, Adria marked the soul of a Dune Dervish and bound it into a ruby. The crystal shattered moments later, but that was expected. What mattered was that she had proof that Kulle's magic worked. Thus, she had to experiment on more demons to ascertain the scope of its power. At some point prior to this, she had thought that a Scouring Charger could contain the essences of the Great Evils, but this turned out to not be the case. After marking the essence of a Subjugator, she decided it was now time to move onto the Great Evils.[4] Over the years, Adria was able to locate the essences of the Great Evils, preparing them for absorption into the Black Soulstone,[11] as per Diablo's plan of taking their essences into himself.[5] Andariel was the first essence which she marked; the ritual was quick, just as Diablo had promised. As she drew Andariel's soul into the Black Soulstone, Andariel looked into Adria's soul as she tried to subdue hers. The Maiden of Anguish discovered what Adria was trying to do, and fought as hard as she could. Adria later reflected that if Andariel had been fully formed, she would have been defeated. Nevertheless, Anguish's essence was marked. Duriel was the second of the Great Evils that Adria marked. She approached him with fear, knowing that if he failed and he imprisoned her in his domain, she could look forward to years, possibly decades of torture before being granted the peace of death. However, when she found Duriel's soul, there was no confrontation. Duriel witnessed Diablo's vision of the End of Days and rejoiced. Even if he would be a 'passenger' to the Lord of Terror, the destruction Diablo would wreck would bring him indescribable pleasures. Thus, Adria marked his soul, using a circle formed from her own blood. The wounds would heal quickly, she reflected. Baal was the third soul that Adria marked. Similar to Duriel, she encountered little resistance, as upon marking his soul, Adria learnt that he desired to see the End of Days as much as Diablo did. Thus, she sent his soul into the Black Soulstone. She expected him to lash out, but she sensed that Baal was content, understanding that he would wait there until Diablo had use for his spirit. If anything, he was amused. Mephisto was the fourth soul that Adria marked. Overconfident with her past victories, Mephisto's hatred caught her off-guard. More than once, he took control of her mind, and if she had not already placed safeguards before the ritual, she knew that she would have been lost. Nevertheless, she completed her task—the live human sacrifices she had carried out previously had served their purpose. With her work complete, Adria was left only with Azmodan and Belial. This presented a problem, as Azmodan ruled from Hell, and Belial had ensnared the nobility of Caldeum, far too well protected to mark alone.[4]  The End of Days[] Caldeum[]  \"I'm surprised Cain never told you why I left. He knew I was called on to fight the Lords of Hell, and I knew he would keep you safe. [...] Then it's fate that we have been reunited. Cain's work, your work, is my war.\"  - Adria introduces herself to Leah(src)     <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/8c/AdriaSerpents.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130807134515\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AdriaSerpents\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/8c/AdriaSerpents.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130807134515\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"85\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AdriaSerpents.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AdriaSerpents.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/8c/AdriaSerpents.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130807134515\"></a>       Adria being tortured by Belial's servants    Twenty years after the destruction of Arreat, the time had come for Diablo's plan to enter its final stage. At this point in time, Adria was in Caldeum, seeking to gather some things before setting out to find the head of Zoltun Kulle, the Black Soulstone's creator. However, she was cornered by the Imperial Guard in the sewers—Belial had enthralled the city, and was aware of the Black Soulstone's existence, if not its function. His demons tortured her until she was saved by a group of heroes, among which were the now-mortal archangel Tyrael, the Nephalem, and Leah herself. She told Leah that she'd watched over her all her life, and had not gotten close due to the shadows that followed her. They returned to the camp that the heroes had set up outside Caldeum.[10]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/e/ea/Adria-cine.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201230070409\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Adria-cine\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/e/ea/Adria-cine.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20201230070409\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"95\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Adria-cine.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Adria-cine.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/e/ea/Adria-cine.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20201230070409\"></a>       Adria after being rescued    Adria told them of her plan to use the Black Soulstone to bind and destroy Belial and Azmodan, and directed the Nephalem to find the head of Zoltun Kulle with the aim of resurrecting him to lead them to the soulstone. Tyrael was uneasy as to the thought of resurrecting him, but when pressed by Adria, admitted that he didn't have a better idea, similarly pointing out to The Nephalem that if Belial or Azmodan invaded, Kulle would be the least of their problems.  While The Nephalem headed to the Dahlgur Oasis to retrieve the head, Adria began training Leah in the use of her abilities. When they returned with the head, Adria had Leah cast a spell she had taught her, resurrecting Kulle's spirit.[14]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/e/ee/AdriaTyraelLeah-archives.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210107123737\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AdriaTyraelLeah-archives\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/e/ee/AdriaTyraelLeah-archives.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210107123737\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"84\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AdriaTyraelLeah-archives.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AdriaTyraelLeah-archives.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/e/ee/AdriaTyraelLeah-archives.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210107123737\"></a>       Adria meets with Leah in the archives    When Kulle was resurrected and the Black Soulstone was completed, the souls of the five dead Lords of Hell, Andariel, Duriel, Mephisto, Diablo and Baal, were drawn into the stone to Kulle's shock. Turning against The Nephalem, Kulle was slain for a second time. Adria told the heroes that her intent for using the stone was destroying the demon lords forever in vengeance for what Diablo did to Tristram two decades ago. Once all seven Evils were trapped within the stone, she said, she would shatter it and the Lords of Hell would be no more. However, it would be Leah who would have to wield the stone itself.[15]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/9c/AdriaLeahSoulstoneTyrael.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210130214525\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AdriaLeahSoulstoneTyrael\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/9c/AdriaLeahSoulstoneTyrael.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210130214525\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"84\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AdriaLeahSoulstoneTyrael.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AdriaLeahSoulstoneTyrael.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/9c/AdriaLeahSoulstoneTyrael.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210130214525\"></a>       Belial is sealed    Armed with the Black Soulstone, the heroes returned to Caldeum to find it under attack by Belial. Adria tried to dissuade Leah and The Nephalem from saving Caldeum's civilians in favor of striking at Belial directly, calling it \"foolish heroism\", but neither Leah nor The Nephalem could ignore the call to save lives, and successfully evacuated Caldeum's citizens and refugees through the sewers.[16] With the people saved, Adria assisted the Nephalem in battling through to the gates of the Imperial Palace, ordering Leah to bring down the gates. When The Nephalem killed Belial, Leah successfully bound his soul into the Black Soulstone, leaving the party only with the issue of Azmodan. She told Leah to go to Caldeum's Great Library, in order to best ascertain where Azmodan would strike.[17] Adria later reflected that Belial's overconfidence had been his downfall, and that he likely was aware of her intentions. If he'd revealed them to her companions, Diablo's plan would have been ruined. Perhaps he had sought to use her and the Black Soulstone to his own ends, she supposed.[4]  Journey to Bastion's Keep[]  \"The pieces are in place. The Black Soulstone holds almost all the raging spirits of the Evils. I sense the final gate approaching, and the key is in my care. The vessel. She still sees me as her mother, but that is not right. She was born of me, but she is not mine. She is his. She will become him. Diablo, reborn. The Seven made One. The Prime Evil. The Lord of the Burning Hells, the broken ruins of Sanctuary, and the High Heavens. And it will be my hand that turns the key.\"  - Adria(src)    On the way to Bastion's Keep, Leah went through Cain's writings, where she learnt of Adria's past connections to the Coven, and Cain's suspicions. Adria admitted her connection to the Coven, but claimed it was part of her quest to wage war against Hell, and 'confessed' she had gone too far.[1] In her writings, Adria mused that Azmodan had likely become aware of Diablo's plan (this was, in fact, the truth). She doubted that he would step foot on Sanctuary as long as the Black Soulstone existed, so therefore she would need help to subdue him in his own domain. Once that happened, she would have precious minutes to draw his soul into the Black Soulstone. If she failed, his soul would enter the process of rebirth, and be forever lost to her.[4]  True Colors[]  \"Twenty years ago, a great and terrible power drew me to Tristram. But Aidan, Leoric's eldest son, defeated that power and sought to contain it within his own flesh. [...] It was Diablo I saw within him. And I pledged myself to his service. Now, at last, his grand design comes to fruition!\"  - Adria reveals her true colors(src)    At Bastion's Keep, while Azmodan's minions lay siege, Adria remained at her daughter's side, as she struggled to contain the essences of the six demon lords imprisoned inside the Black Soulstone.[18] Over the days and nights, Adria stayed at Leah's side.[19] During the siege, Leah temporarily lost control of the soulstone, resulting in the release of Terror Spawn. The Nephalem was able to defeat them, and Adria stated that the demons' rage inside the stone had temporarily subdued. For how long though, Tyrael asked? He stated that they had to take the fight to Azmodan himself.[20] While Tyrael and The Nephalem were outside the keep, Leah had another vision; one of \"twisted demonic towers and enormous hearts beating within them.\" She headed across the battlefield and found Tyrael and The Nephalem, telling them of what Leah had seen. Tyrael identified the constructs as Sin Hearts, realizing that Azmodan had dredged them up from his realm in order to empower his legions.[21] Eventually, Azmodan was defeated, and Adria and Leah were there as the latter imprisoned the last lord of Hell within the stone. Victory was in sight, and Adria stated that the stone would have to be taken back to the keep, to make preparations to destroy it and in turn, the demon lords it contained.    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/ce/AdriaTyrael.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130807140537\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AdriaTyrael\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/ce/AdriaTyrael.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130807140537\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"85\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AdriaTyrael.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AdriaTyrael.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/ce/AdriaTyrael.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20130807140537\"></a>       Adria's betrayal    At the keep, however, Adria revealed her true colors, slaughtering a number of soldiers, and incapacitating both Tyrael and Leah. She revealed her true allegiance and her real purpose for the Black Soulstone as well as who Leah's true father was, just before turning the Black Soulstone upon her daughter. Thus, Diablo was reborn in the world in a new vessel, as a singular Prime Evil, the embodiment of all seven Great Evils in one being. After over twenty years, Adria had completed the task that was assigned to her. Diablo was pleased, and ordered Adria to leave until he needed her again. She thus disappeared through a portal, while Diablo departed to lead an invasion of the High Heavens.[19] It was an invasion that ultimately failed, and Diablo was ultimately cast down by the Nephalem. Adria however, remained at large.[6]  Reaper of Souls[]  \"Diablo will return. I have done what I can to ensure it. He always finds a way. In your heart of hearts, you know this...\"  - Adria(src)    Adria entered the Blood Marsh not long after the events at Bastion's Keep.[22] She knew that Diablo had fallen and that the Black Soulstone had fallen into the hands of Malthael, but maintained that the Lord of Terror would return, and sought to retrieve the stone. Her former allies attempted to locate Malthael after he unleashed his Reapers upon Westmarch. After the defeat of Urzael, Myriam Jahzia told the Nephalem that Adria was the only one who knew where Malthael was hiding, and that she had gone to the Blood Marsh.    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/92/AdriaCorvus.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180908102057\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AdriaCorvus\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/92/AdriaCorvus.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20180908102057\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"129\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AdriaCorvus.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AdriaCorvus.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/92/AdriaCorvus.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20180908102057\"></a>       Adria inside Corvus    Thirsting for vengeance for the betrayal at Bastion's Keep that had destroyed Leah and unleashed the Prime Evil upon Heaven itself, the heroes journeyed through the marsh, where they battled creatures that had been corrupted by Adria's newfound blood magic. The trail led them to the Ruins of Corvus, an ancient Nephalem city where they encountered blood golems also created by Adria. The heroes finally cornered Adria in the Great Hall, just in time to learn that the Angel of Death had gone to Pandemonium.    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/5/55/AdriaCube.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140523104739\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AdriaCube\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/5/55/AdriaCube.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140523104739\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"101\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AdriaCube.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AdriaCube.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/5/55/AdriaCube.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140523104739\"></a>       Adria transformed    Adria declared that the angels would never suffer humanity to live, and that they could not accept that humans could choose their own path, stating that at least demons were not so rigid in their beliefs. And with that, Adria threw herself into a pit of blood before re-emerging as a massive Blood Demon to do battle with the Nephalem. During the battle, she noted that Diablo sent her a vision of his return, with none other than the Nephalem releasing him. The heroes slew Adria, exacting justice for her betrayal and avenging her daughter, but the vision came to pass; during the final battle with Malthael, the Angel of Death shattered the Black Soulstone and absorbed the essence of the Prime Evil into himself, and when the Nephalem finally defeated him, Diablo's essence was loosed back into the world,[23] still containing the other six Great Evils.[24]  Legacy[]  \"Witch. Heretic. Traitor.

A representation of Tristram as she remembered it during its fall was briefly constructed, along with manifestations of Diablo and his lieutenants as they existed then.[26]  In-game[] Diablo I[] Adria's shop is located in the east of the Tristram map, far beyond the city borders, accessible through a small bridge. She sells and buys:  Magic Books Mana Potions Elixirs (on the very late stages of the game, each costs 5000 gold, and she rarely has more than one) Magic Staves Scrolls Runes (in Hellfire only) She can recharge player's magic staff for a fee, but unlike Sorcerer's ability, it will not reduce the maximum number of charges. Adria also starts (and finishes) the Black Mushroom quest.  Quotes[] I sense a soul in search of answers... Gossip[] Wisdom is earned, not given.

The innkeeper Ogden serves more of a purpose in this town than many understand. He provides shelter for Gillian and her matriarch, maintains what life Farnham has left to him, and provides an anchor for all who are left in the town to what Tristram once was. His tavern, and the simple pleasures that can still be found there, provide a glimpse of a life that the people here remember. It is that memory that continues to feed their hopes for your success. Diablo Immortal[] Adria's activities in the period between Diablo II and Diablo III will be touched on in Diablo Immortal.[27] She will appear in the game itself.[28]  Diablo III[]   Adria            Appears in  Diablo IIIDiablo III: Reaper of Souls     Significance  Major     Service(s)  Gossip, Quest initiation     Residence(s)  Caldeum, Bastion's Keep (Diablo III)Ruins of Corvus (Reaper of Souls)     Starts quest(s)  Lord of Lies, Heart of Sin     Portrayed by  Alyson Reed   In Diablo III, Adria is first met during the Unexpected Allies quest in Act II, where you are tasked with rescuing her from Belial's Imperial Guard in the Wretched Pit in the sewers of Caldeum. She aids you both during the battle in the Pit and during the final assault on the Imperial Palace. In both cases, she attacks with fireballs that deal minor damage. She can draw the enemy's attention, and cannot be killed as she is marked as an essential quest NPC. Aside from this, Adria spends most of her time in the Hidden Camp in Act II, and in The Armory of Bastion's Keep in Act III, watching over Leah. Act III only sees her participate in battle once, during the swarm of the Terror Spawn in the Armory when Leah temporarily loses control of the Black Soulstone. In gameplay, she only leaves the Armory when she gives the Heart of Sin quest after you kill the Siegebreaker Assault Beast, and in the cutscene where Leah seals Azmodan's soul within the Black Soulstone. In both acts where she appears, Adria has a variety of conversation options, and going through every one of her conversations earns the player the \"Bewitched\" achievement. Adria disappears following the betrayal that ends Act III and does not return for the remainder of the regular game.

The battle takes place in a square arena, with an impassable pool of blood in the center and two Healing Wells in two opposite corners. The combat starts immediately after entering the Great Hall in the Ruins of Corvus. After a cutscene (and her transformation) Adria gains the following combat abilities:  Slash: a rapid melee strike, only used if all other attacks are on cooldown. Wing Slash: Adria raises her wing menacingly, swiping a cone in front of her over 1 second. Deals heavy Physical damage, but can be avoided if noticed in time. Arcane Rune a.k.a. Blood Ball: places a small pool of arcane energy beneath the player's feet. This pool deals average Arcane damage over time, but has a very small radius. Whirlpool a.k.a. Blood Pool: Adria instantly teleports to another location (usually into close combat with the player), dealing Physical damage within 10 yards of both starting and destination points. Before cast, one may see a black rune glowing beneath her feet. Blood Rain: Adria's main weapon; every 25% of health, or every 45 seconds, she will use Whirlpool to move back to her starting position. Once there, for 3 seconds she cannot perform any actions (and is vulnerable at that moment), and after that, calls down a rain of blood oozes. The oozes are invulnerable and untargetable, crawling erratically over the arena, and if stepped on, create a pool of blood dealing average Physical damage over time. Each pool exists for roughly 15 seconds, but oozes do not despawn until stepped on.   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/a/ab/Adria2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170511161404\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Adria2\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/a/ab/Adria2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20170511161404\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"117\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Adria2.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Adria2.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/a/ab/Adria2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20170511161404\"></a>       Adria's demonic form in-game model    On Torment difficulty, Adria does not have the Enrage timer, but has a soft enrage of her own: unless killed quickly, she will overwhelm the player with Blood Rain oozes, covering the entire arena with those, making it impossible to move without stepping on them. Increased movement speed is advised in this battle, as all Adria's abilities can be avoided by moving quickly. High Physical resistance also helps. Upon death, she had a chance to drop Osseous Grasp in 2.4.1 PTR, but does not do so in the live game.

She didn't have time for the merely curious. In her thirties, she had raven-black hair,[2] though come her fifties, it had started to go gray.[29] During the End of Days, she still appeared quite young, which proved to be surprising for others, though she responded quite icily to anyone who asked for her true age.[11] Cain noted that if there was one constant about Adria, it was her lust for power.[1] For Adria herself, power was \"knowing how to use things to get what you want.\" She saw all of Sanctuary as a vault of riches that could be exploited; every creature, every plant, and every culture could provide a source of power. This included groups like the Mage Clans and Zakarum, the pertinent question to Adria being \"are they powerful,\" and if so, what could be gained from them.[4] Being a witch, Adria often practiced the darker healing practices, being able to fight the diseases against which other healers were powerless.[30] Possibly as a consequence of her own father's negligence and lack of love, Adria was very cold-hearted. She gladly helped peasants get rid of their unborn children, and did not have any regret upon finding out what would happen to her own daughter. As Adria herself stated, \"daughters are a cheap thing\".[30] In her own writings, she referred to Leah as \"the vessel,\" and stated that while Leah had been born of her, she was not her daughter. She was Diablo's.[4] Adria had a high opinion of herself, that through her alliance with Diablo, he was granting what destiny 'owed' her.[4] Adria had some sympathy towards the khazra, given their origins at the hands of the Vizjerei Clan. When the khazra turned against their creators, Adria noted that any mage that met their ends at the hands of goatmen was \"a fate well earned.\" She similarly had a low opinion of Zakarumites, considering them \"mindless zealots,\" but respected their inquisitors' mastery of torture. She was wary of the risks of demonic possession; she was willing to work with demons, but would do so on her own terms. However, she saw angels as the most dangerous threat to humanity; she learnt of the pact made at the end of the Sin War, that the angels had spared humanity by only the slimmest of margins. However, her hatred for angels faded over times, reasoning that one \"cannot blame any creature for their nature.\" As with demons, angels were slaves to their own nature in her eyes. Malthael was the only member of the Angiris Council she respected, given how he had abandoned the council and seen the futility of their efforts to prevent Hell from corrupting humanity. Even for humanity itself, Adria had contempt, and saw its inevitable end as a natural thing.[4] At least during the Darkening of Tristram, Adria's accent conformed to the style of speech used in Kingsport.[1]  Abilities[]  \"I have always wondered how much Adria relied on Diablo's power instead of her own. Based on her blood golems, her magic is very strong.\"  - Lorath Nahr(src)    A tenacious individual,[31] Adria was in tune with the ebb and flow of magic[2] and had great affinity for it,[1] though claimed to The Nephalem that she spent a lifetime studying magic, and that it did not come easily to her.[15] Lorath Nahr would later speculate as to the extent that Adria relied on Diablo for her magic, but concluded that her own magic was nonetheless strong.[32] She also possessed the gift of foresight.[13] She was also skilled in the making of herbs, elixirs, oils,[2] poisons, drawing,[4] and potions,[13] and possessed much knowledge in mysticism and demonology.[9]  Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.  According to The Awakening, Adria was once a well regarded member of the Vizjerei Clan, but for undisclosed reasons, was outcast from the order and labeled as a witch. Whenever asked about her time with the Vizjerei, Adria refused to respond. This backstory was apparently retconned through Book of Tyrael, where it established that Adria joined the Coven early on and only left during the Darkening of Tristram. The name of the achievement for killing Adria in Hardcore Torment mode without crowd-controlling enemies, \"Really Most Sincerely Dead\", is a possible reference to the Wizard of Oz. In The Sanctuary Tarot Deck and Guidebook Adria represents Two of Cups and Queen of Pentacles cards.

There is a wooden barricade on the right side of it but it is indestructible at first until you enter the Cellar. Upon finding and entering the Hidden Cellar of the hut, the two of you are set upon by Captain Daltyn and his men, who have become risen dead. Adria's Journal is found within the hut. After exiting the cellar it is possible to break through the wooden barricade in the hut. During the Darkening of Tristram event, there is a small group of three cows.

Adria's Journal is a nine-part tome found in Act V of Diablo III, written by Adria. It can be acquired by opening Adria's Satchel in the Overgrown Ruins, Blood Marsh and Paths of the Drowned during the quest The Witch. They read as follows:  The first time I saw a witch, she burned. Father took me to the town square to see it. \"Look,\" he said. \"That is the face of evil.\" But she looked like any other woman, and burned like anything else. Then the flames engulfed her, her eyes found mine, and she laughed. My father could never understand. He was born into privilege and wealth, and he spent every moment of his life trying to protect it. I was his flesh and blood, but he cared more about the names in books and the faces of the paintings on the walls than his living daughter. Do you know what fear is? The fear of who you are, the fear of what your own blood would do if they knew what you were. No, you could never understand it. People look to you as a savior. Have you ever thought about the lives you've taken? They were fathers, lovers... daughters. They asked me what I see when I look into the fire. I see a burning man. I see a burning witch. I see terror and a hunger that will consume everything. What hope do the works of men have against such all-consuming hunger? I gave myself to the flames. My father burned. He screamed as the flames consumed him, and the smell was...sickly sweet. He had found me -- for once in his life, he had noticed me -- and when he saw that the flames did not touch me, he breathed one word. It was his last. \"Witch,\" they called me. But I turned it against them. When their daughter had a child that needed to disappear, when there was a sickness that none of the healers could cure, who was it they pleaded with? When they needed me, the morality they flaunted in the daylight disappeared. As it always does. The first time I heard him, his voice pierced my skull. It reminded me of the cold and haughty sound of my father, but it was more, a crush of thousands of voices. When I heard him, I saw the flames, and I knew fear. It was a man who came to my bed that night, but when I looked into his eyes, I saw the other, though even he did not know at the time. I did not hear the man's voice, no. I heard the other, the one that has been with me for all these years. I gave myself to him. Leah was never my daughter. She was Diablo's daughter in truth. I felt blessed to have given the product of my body to my master. He had no interest in me, but in the product of my womb, he found life again. I never flinched when I knew her purpose. Daughters are a cheap thing.

Adria: For a time, during the Darkening of Tristram, we spent many nights in the Tavern of the Rising Sun,m discussing his Horadric texts and the varied arcana I'd collected during my travels. Player: Did you ever meet him again? Adria: Only from afar. From time to time, our paths would cross, and I would catch glimpses of Leah as she grew. It broke my heart that I could not reveal myself and raise her as my own.

A legend. There is no doubt in my mind he is as powerful as the stories say. But for every bit of his genius, he was surely mad. He was obsessed with immortality and power. Tyrael: A madman. We would do better to leave him asleep in the desert than call on him for aid. Adria: You have a better idea? Tyrael: I do not. It is merely a warning.    Tyrael's Warning[] Available at the start of the quest: Betrayer of the Horadrim (Act II)Unlocked by The Mad Wizard  Player: Tyrael said not to trust Zoltun Kulle. What do you think? Adria: It will be dangerous, but you have faced great peril before. If Belial and Azmodan invade, you will have much more to worry about than a dismembered wizard.   The Price of Victory[] Available at the start of the quest: The Scourging of Caldeum (Act II)  Adria: Know this: I have given everything, even my own blood-my own daughter-so that I could hunt Belial and Azmodan. Do not question my dedication. I have given more than any, and I will give more before the end comes.  Leah's Birth[] Available at the start of the quest: Betrayer of the Horadrim (Act II)  Player: Was it difficult to abandon Leah? Adria: What?! No, I never saw it that way. She grew up in safety while I risked my life to find the key to our salvation. It was the sacrifice that I had to make. In any case, Leah will meet her full potential under my guidance. Do you not have things to do?   Motives[] Available at the start of the quest: Betrayer of the Horadrim (Act II)  Adria: After surviving the devastation of Tristram all those years ago, I swore vengeance upon Diablo and his ilk. I've sacrificed everything for it. This is my path and I will follow it through to its bloody end.   Adria's Capture[] Available at the start of the quest: Betrayer of the Horadrim (Act II)  Player: How did the Imperial Guard find you? Adria: I was trying to steal out of the city. I'd returned to gather some things before setting out to recover Zoltun Kulle's head, and the guards found me.  Your Daughter[] Available at the start of the quest: Blood and Sand (Act II)  Player: Leah has great faith in you. Adria: She has a kind heart. Player: Is that not good? Adria: Kindness will not help us survive in these dark times.   Belial and the Soulstone[] Available at the start of the quest: Blood and Sand (Act II)  Adria: The lord of lies is cunning. He wears many masks to hide his shifting nature from us. But we will have an advantage over him-the Black Soulstone. Belial fears its power, for soulstones have bested his siblings in the past and he could be imprisoned as well.    Magic[] Available before the start of the quest: The Scouring of Caldeum (Act II)*Jump to this quest but talk to Adria before actually starting it from Leah.  Player: Leah is growing into her own. Adria: The power was always within her. Now she's learning to control it. Player: Did she get her power from you? Adria: I do not know where her power comes from. I spent a lifetime studying the ways of magic. It did not come easily to me.   Adria's Quest[] Available before the start of the quest: The Scouring of Caldeum (Act II)*Jump to this quest but talk to Adria before actually starting it from Leah.  Adria: While I was in Tristrsam, Deckard Cain told me of a black soulstone crafted by a renegade Horadrim. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but later, realized its true significance. I knew the essences of the five slain Lords of Hell still existed in our world, so I spent the last twenty years locating and preparing them to be drawn into the stone when it was finished. Player: Finished? Adria: Kulle was interrupted during his first attempt. Now that the soulstone is finally complete, the Lords of Hell have been trapped within it.  Ensnaring Belial[] Available before the start of the quest: The Scouring of Caldeum (Act II)*Jump to this quest but talk to Adria before actually starting it from Leah.  Adria: Controlling the Black Soulstone will be perilous. Player: But you can do it? Adria: It won't be me who will use it. Only Leah, under my guidance, can wield it. Her power is far greater than mine, and will ensure its success.   Azmodan[] Available at the start of the quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)*Everything else so far disappears in Act III.  Player: The end of Azmodan will come to pass, and the Black Soulstone will be his prison. His great evil will be banished from this world. Adria: Only fools celebrate victory before the battle's has begun. Along with Belial, Azmodan has ruled the ravening hordes of the Burning Hells for over three centuries. His cunning is beyond imagining. Player: The voices of the Unformed Land seek his death. I will give it to them.  Suffering[] Available after the start of the quest: Turning the Tide (Act III) by talking to Tyrael  Player: The suffering your daughter endures must weigh heavily upon you. Adria: Everyone suffers. But to do so for a cause greater than oneself-that is the mark of a true hero. My daughter is everything I hoped she would be.   The War's End[] Available after the start of the quest: Machines of War (Act III)  Player: Azmodan becomes weak. We will soon defeat him. What will you do then? Adria: The war will never end for me. Even if we defeat all evil forever, I will carry the scars of this nightmare till the end of my days. Player: Some scars so not heal, but what of Leah? She may not be bound to our fate. Adria: I wish Leah could have the life I never had. But in truth, I fear she'll be damned as well. Player: Leah is stronger than you know, She may yet come to know a life without the memory of these nightmares."},{"pageTitle":"Adventure Journal","pageContent":"An Adventure Journal    Adventure Journals are a type of item in Diablo Immortal.

The idea for Adventure Mode came from requests to use waypoints to move freely between acts.[3] The mechanic of one Act giving increased rewards for Bounties existed at one point, removed in later patches: it involved one Act being selected as default starting Act for all logins into the game, changing every hour. Even after becoming no longer relevant, it still follows this pattern. References[]   ↑ 2015-12-11, PATCH 2.4.0 PREVIEW: GREYHOLLOW ISLAND.

With Wormhole, the additional free cast will cost no Arcane Power, but will leave a 0.5 seconds cooldown after the 1-second window.

Their court was set up in an abandoned monastery at Tristram and over time, Leoric gained the respect of the people.[2] Aidan was tutored by Deckard Cain.[1] Over time however, Leoric's mood became increasingly erratic, his rule brutal and in the throes of such madness, he sent his army against the neighbouring kingdom of Westmarch. Aidan was among the soldiers sent into battle.[2]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Return to Tristram[]  \"Thank goodness you've returned!

Follow the path that lies between my tavern and the blacksmith shop to find the church and save who you can. Perhaps I can tell you more if we speak again. Good luck.\"  - Ogden greets Aidan upon his return(src)             Aidan before his fall    The war against Westmarch was a disaster, the armies of Khanduras being cut to shreds.[3] Aidan survived however, and made his way back to Tristram, already suffering under whatever evil was plaguing it and drawing numerous adventurers to the town because of it (that, and gold). By the time Aidan arrived, things had gotten even worse. His father had been struck down by the knight Lachdanan, Albrecht was missing and his kingdom was in shambles.[2] Aidan vowed to rescue his brother and banish whatever power had gripped the kingdom,[2] though Cain urged caution. He warned Aidan of the demons beneath the cathedral and of the undead, how he might have to face those he once knew. Cain also pointed out that there were others who could aid him[1] and as such he was joined by a Rogue named Moreina, who was part of the Sisters of the Sightless Eye and a Vizjerei Sorcerer, Jazreth.[2]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/39/Aidan-journal.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140504134023\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Aidan-journal\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/39/Aidan-journal.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140504134023\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"138\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Aidan-journal.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Aidan-journal.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/39/Aidan-journal.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140504134023\"></a>       Aidan in armor    Venturing into the cathedral, Aidan and his companions faced the horror and might of the Burning Hells. Quickly dispatching a demon called the Butcher, they soon encountered Leoric, now the Skeleton King. Witnessing the reanimated visage of his father was a harrowing encounter for Aidan, made even more heartbreaking by the fact that he was forced to strike him down. Aidan brought news of the king's death before returning into the labyrinth.[2] The heroes pressed on, making their way into the catacombs under the monastery, eventually discovering the Staff of Lazarus, which belonged to the bishop that had been Leoric's advisor.[2] The same bishop had led Tristram's people into the labyrinth to be slaughtered before disappearing.[4] Returning to Tristram, Aidan presented the staff to Deckard Cain, claiming that it was clear that Lazarus had deceived his people.[2] Cain was not sure what to make of it, but realized that Lazarus himself must have kidnapped Albrecht. With this knowledge, Aidan and his companions made their way to the Unholy Altar.[4]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/31/AidanLazarus.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140504134345\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AidanLazarus\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/31/AidanLazarus.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140504134345\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AidanLazarus.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AidanLazarus.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/31/AidanLazarus.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140504134345\"></a>       Aidan confronts Lazarus    Lazarus was powerful and had many demons at his side, but in the end, he was struck down. A youth had been sacrificed to whatever dark power he served, but it wasn't Albrecht. Returning to Cain again, the scholar told Aidan of what lurked beneath the labyrinth—Diablo, Lord of Terror.[4] With this knowledge, Aidan and his companions ventured back into the labyrinth for one last battle.[2] As Aidan would later put it, Diablo's realm was \"the threshold of Hell itself.\" It was a realm fitted for Diablo certainly, for not only was their struggle physical, but mental as well. The demon forced Aidan to relive his worst nightmares, his greatest failures, and his fears that he would never live up to the expectations of his father. But, driven by the belief that his brother could still be saved, Aidan pressed on. He and his companions wore the demon down until, ultimately, Aidan struck the final blow...only for it to be revealed that Diablo had used Albrecht as his host.[2]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/4/4d/Aidan-scream.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140504134658\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Aidan-scream\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/4/4d/Aidan-scream.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140504134658\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"86\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Aidan-scream.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Aidan-scream.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/4/4d/Aidan-scream.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140504134658\"></a>       Aidan's agony    Deckard Cain would later speculate that Aidan seeing his brother's body before him would have shattered his mind.[2] Regardless, whatever may have run through Aidan's head, there was one last loose end: Diablo's soulstone. Broken by Lazarus, it could not contain the demon indefinitely. Believing he could contain Diablo's essence, he plunged the soulstone into his forehead. Blood filled his vision, the whispers of the damned echoed in his ears and Aidan could feel Diablo himself clawing his way up from the dark recesses of his soul. But he had done it. Diablo had been contained.[5]  Nightmares[]  \"Many moons have passed since I left the town of Tristram behind me. Since then I've tried to forget the terrors I beheld beneath the cold earth. And the twisted nightmares that have haunted my every waking moment. There's something dark within me now. I can feel it. Driving me towards the east. Assuring me that my salvation lies within the ruins of ancient kingdoms. Though I know the way, I know not what perils will rise to hinder my journey. And as I pass through the first gate, I know that the better part of my soul will remain behind.

It was a victory to Tristram, but it was clear that Aidan was not the same person he once was. He increasingly shunned the company of others, spending the day in isolation and the night wandering the streets, seemingly without direction or purpose.[2] Ultimately, the witch, Adria, seemed to be the only person who could offer him comfort, and the two spent long nights behind closed doors.[2] This, however, was not of Aidan's intent, but of Diablo's. Adria saw the truth, that Aidan had not contained Diablo at all, and pledged herself to the Lord of Terror's service. Through Aidan, Diablo impregnated Adria, conceiving a child who would be his vessel. It would be over two decades, but when the time was right, Diablo would return to claim his prize.[6]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/33/Aidan_BoC1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120728051744\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Aidan BoC1\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/33/Aidan_BoC1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20120728051744\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"267\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Aidan BoC1.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Aidan_BoC1.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/33/Aidan_BoC1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20120728051744\"></a>       Aidan heads east    Aidan was cordial to those who approached him, but his mood didn't improve. In an attempt to liven it, a celebration was thrown in his honor. However, he slipped away during the event. That same evening, Cain visited him, finding Aidan muttering to himself, wearing a dark garb and a hood that covered his face.[7] Aidan eventually related his story to Deckard Cain, telling him of his battle with Diablo. After the tale, he kept mumbling, whispering \"I thought I could contain it, I thought I could contain it...\" before mentioning his \"brothers\" awaiting him in the east. Cain could see that Aidan was disturbed, but at the time, saw it as meaningless ramblings. The next day however, Aidan was gone,[2] armed only with a sword and some provisions.[7] According to Adria, he had traveled east, to seek out mystics who might exorcise the waking nightmare that plagued him. A half-truth. But as demons descended on Tristram after Aidan's departure, it was clear that there would be no-one from the town capable of following him.[2]  Journey to Aranoch[]  \"Why did I follow him...? I don't know. Why do things happen as they do in dreams? All I know is that, when he beckoned... I had to follow him. From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.\"  - Marius recounts his story(src)      <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/80/WandererMonastery2.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20230605084407\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"WandererMonastery2\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/80/WandererMonastery2.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230605084407\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"82\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"WandererMonastery2.JPG\" data-image-key=\"WandererMonastery2.JPG\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/80/WandererMonastery2.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230605084407\"></a>       The Dark Wanderer in the Rogue Monastery    Aidan, or what was left of him, now had a new moniker—the Dark Wanderer. A vessel for Diablo and little else. Heading east, he sought passage to the port of Lut Gholein. Passing through the Eastgate Monastery, the Wanderer encountered the Sisters of the Sightless Eye, many of whom had recently been corrupted by Andariel, now come over to the cause of the Prime Evils.[2] The monastery desecrated, the Wanderer stopped at a tavern situated in the mountains that separated Aranoch from Kehjistan. Summoning demons and the forms of the undead to his side, the Wanderer set the tavern ablaze and everyone in it, apart for one—Marius, who had fled the Rogue Monastery. For whatever reason, the Wanderer beckoned to Marius to follow, and he did.[8] For many weeks, the pair traveled across Aranoch. During the trip, the Wanderer told Marius of his past as a warrior, and that a burden had been placed on him. Eventually, they came within sight of Lut Gholein. The pair made camp, and Marius shared the Wanderer's dreams. Dreams that were more akin to memories, depicting the Horadric mage Tal Rasha being bound to contain the essence of Baal. As the Wanderer explained, it was Baal who he sought. They set out with the dawn, searching for the Tomb of Tal Rasha.[9]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/b3/Tyrael_vs_Wanderer_in_D2_Resurrected.png/revision/latest?cb=20230605091913\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Tyrael vs Wanderer in D2 Resurrected\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/b3/Tyrael_vs_Wanderer_in_D2_Resurrected.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230605091913\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"82\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Tyrael vs Wanderer in D2 Resurrected.png\" data-image-key=\"Tyrael_vs_Wanderer_in_D2_Resurrected.png\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/b/b3/Tyrael_vs_Wanderer_in_D2_Resurrected.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230605091913\"></a>       Tyrael battles The Wanderer    Finding the tomb, the Wanderer appeared to gain strength. Or rather, as Marius observed, appeared to be losing what was left of his humanity, his visage becoming more demonic. Either way, the Wanderer led the way into the tomb, undeterred by the gloom. Eventually, the pair reached the Binding Stone where Tal Rasha, barely containing Baal, stood. The Wanderer moved forward to release the Lord of Destruction but it was here that the archangel Tyrael intervened. The Wanderer and angel did battle but Marius, manipulated by Baal, released him. Marius promptly fled with Baal's soulstone,[10] but it mattered not. Baal was free. Tyrael was imprisoned in his place. And with that, the Wanderer and Baal set sail to Kurast.[2]  Hellfire[]  \"Now my young brother, the time has come to assume your true form! Arise Diablo, Lord of Terror!\"  - Mephisto(src)    The Wanderer had a close shave at Kurast with a band of heroes that had been pursuing him, but managed to escape their grasp.[2][11] Soon afterwards, the Wanderer and Baal arrived at Travincal, entering the Temple of Light. Zakarum had already been partially corrupted by Mephisto's influence, but Diablo used his powers of fear to cause the uncorrupted defenders to flee and/or turn on each other. Regardless, Mephisto's soulstone was found, and the Lord of Hatred quickly took possession of Que-Hegan Sankekur. After centuries, the Prime Evils were reunited.    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/7/75/Lost_light.gif/revision/latest?cb=20220830080810\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Lost light\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/7/75/Lost_light.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220830080810\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"101\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Lost light.gif\" data-image-key=\"Lost_light.gif\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/7/75/Lost_light.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220830080810\"></a>       Aidan's last moments    Within a chamber, the Primes devised a final stratagem to retake the Burning Hells, claim vengeance on those who had turned on them and use their corrupted soulstones to corrupt the Worldstone, thereby enslaving humanity to their will. The Infernal Gate was opened and Diablo took full control over the Wanderer's body, assuming his true form. The Wanderer had served the Lord of Terror well, and Aidan seemed to be lost forever. However, the heroes that had pursued the Wanderer over the months had not given up, and confronted Diablo himself. Cain would speculate that even then, some small part of Aidan's old self remained, that as the heroes fought the demon without, Aidan fought him within. Regardless, Diablo was defeated, his essence returned to his soulstone and like Albrecht before him, Aidan's body was left behind. In honor of his memory, the champions ceremonially wrapped his broken body and threw it into the infernal fires that raged all around them.[2]  Legacy[]  \"Your ghosts are many, old man, and they are active.\"  - The demon prior to taking Aidan's form(src)    Years after his death, Cain remained guilt-ridden by what had happened to his former friend. Eight years after Aidan's death, while in a Vizjerei repository, a demon briefly took Aidan's form in order to psychologically torment Cain.[1] Two decades after Aidan's death, when walking the path to the Tristram Cathedral, Li-Ming reflected that it was as if she was stepping back in time, following in the footsteps of the Dark Wanderer.[12]  In-game[] Diablo I[] Main article: Warrior Aidan is the canon hero and represented by the Warrior class in Diablo I, though remains nameless throughout the game.

The player cannot interact with him in any way. If the player listens carefully, they can hear the Wanderer laugh as he teleports away. Aidan's journey is charted through flashbacks in the form of the game's cinematics.  Diablo Immortal[] While not referenced directly, the Wicked Wanderer cosmetic set appears to take inspiration from the Dark Wanderer.  Diablo III[] Aidan is mentioned multiple times in Diablo III. Messerschmidt's Reaver description implies that it may be the very same weapon he used to defeat Diablo with back in the first game. A transmogrification-only weapon called Aidan's Revenge is both named after him and also claims that he himself killed The Butcher.

This included the ability to transform into the Cow King. To similarly commemorate the anniversary, a Dark Wanderer player icon was made available in Overwatch.

His experiences in war against Westmarch tempered him. However, he was broken physically and mentally due to Diablo's influence,[2] and while shards of humanity remained within him, he steadily lost them over time as Diablo asserted his control.[8][10] Aidan was considered handsome before his fall.[1]  Notes[]   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/c9/Wanderer_Skull.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120728030659\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Wanderer Skull\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/c9/Wanderer_Skull.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20120728030659\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"224\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Wanderer Skull.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Wanderer_Skull.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/c/c9/Wanderer_Skull.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20120728030659\"></a>       Artwork of the Dark Wander from Diablo II    The concept behind Aidan is effectively retroactive, as up until the conception of Diablo III, he was never given a name besides the \"Dark Wanderer\". In the first game, he was never given a name and did not conceptually exist; like the other classes, the Warrior merely represented all such individuals who traveled to Tristram to fight the Darkness. In Diablo II, it was established that the Warrior class was the hero to canonically slay Diablo, and was given the title of the Dark Wanderer. However, his backstory remained the same as the warrior class, that he was a nameless hero. One fact was retconned: Deckard Cain spoke of the Dark Wanderer as though he was foreign to Tristram, but NPCs in the game speak to the player as though the player is a villager returning from a long journey. This was also added to in the game's manual, as written by Deckard Cain. A warrior/thief character named Qarak appears in The Awakening as a possible take on giving the Wanderer a name, but can still conceptually exist as his own character. By Diablo III, the Warrior's background had been further altered, being given the name of \"Aidan\" with the backstory that he was Leoric's elder son. This is effectively a retcon, as previous lore had stated that Leoric only had one son (Albrecht), and, in Diablo, the people of Tristram reacted no differently to the Warrior than to the other classes, despite Aidan being known to them. This is slightly amended in Book of Cain, where Cain explains that he used the term \"Dark Wanderer\" to describe Aidan because he could not bring himself to use his name after his fall. Marius and other characters used the name \"Dark Wanderer\" as well, which can more sensibly be justified in that few outside of Tristram knew the Wanderer's true identity.

Akara is a quiet, dignified woman,[1] who intones rather than speaks. She is naturally suspicious of outsiders.[2] Deckard Cain described her as being soft-spoken, inscrutable, and wise.[3] She believes that more women are needed to fight against the enemies of Sanctuary.[4]    Contents  1 Biography  1.1 The Sightless Eye 1.2 The Bloodsworn   2 In-game  2.1 Diablo II  2.1.1 Dialogue  2.1.1.1 Greetings 2.1.1.2 Introduction 2.1.1.3 Gossip 2.1.1.4 Den of Evil 2.1.1.5 Sister's Burial Grounds 2.1.1.6 Search for Cain 2.1.1.7 The Forgotten Tower 2.1.1.8 Tools of the Trade 2.1.1.9 Sisters to the Slaughter 2.1.1.10 Gossip about Akara     2.2 Diablo Immortal   3 Trivia 4 References    Biography[] During her time in the Sisterhood, Akara became practiced in the use of the Sightless Eye.[3] She oversaw the spiritual aspects of the Order, while Kashya oversaw military matters. Kashya regarded Akara as being a surrogate mother.[4]  The Sightless Eye[] When Moreina returned from Tristram, Akara felt ill at ease. She suspected that Moreina had stumbled upon some evil force beneath the town.[4] In 1264, when Akara was in her early forties,[1] Eastgate Keep was captured by Andariel. She corrupted many Rogues and drove the rest of the Sisterhood out of their ancestral home. Akara ended up in an encampment in the wilderness of Khanduras.[4] She resided in a simple hut which granted her more privacy than other areas of the camp.[1] Akara was deeply affected by the loss of Eastgate, and Charsi feared that she blamed herself for what had happened. Some travelers arrived in the camp, including Warriv and Gheed. She did her best to stay clear of the latter.           Akara talks to one of the heroes    Afterwards, a group of heroes in pursuit of the Dark Wanderer arrived in the camp. She implored them to find a way to lift Andariel's curse.[4] After they cleansed the Den of Evil, they gained her trust.[5] Aware of the threat Andariel represented, Akara bid the heroes travel to Tristram in order to find Deckard Cain. They succeeded,[6] and later went on to defeat Andariel. She thanked the heroes for their efforts, and hoped that one day, the Sisterhood could be rebuilt.[7] While at the camp (or potentially in the following years), Cain entrusted Akara with a tome of Horadric origin. However, she later commented that \"its strange magics were never meant for me.\"[8]  After the events with Andariel, Charsi chose to leave the Sisterhood. Before she left, Akara gave her an amulet that, if used, would open a portal to the Dark Wood, in case Charsi ever had to find her way back home.[9]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     The Bloodsworn[]  \"As you have undoubtedly seen, the Dark Wood suffers greatly at the hands of the Bloodsworn. Their leader, Lakrii, was once one of us...until her heart was broken. She abandoned us and made a new family, while tearing apart her old one.\"  - Akara(src)             Akara    In 1270, Akara, still high priestess of the sisterhood, was in the Dark Wood, as she and her forces moved against the Bloodsworn. While at their camp, she was introduced to a hero/group of heroes, who told her that they had been sent by Cain; that he had hoped that she could help them find one of the shards of the Worldstone which had fallen in the area. Akara mused that a Worldstone shard could explain the Bloodsworn's power. She agreed to provide the hero(es) with assistance, and gave them the tome Cain had provided her with years prior, commenting that Cain had sent them here \"to complete the circle.\" She gave them the tome, and instructed them to speak with Hemlir.[8] After failing to conduct a ritual to cleanse the Dark Wood's corruption, Hemlir turned to Akara for advice. She intoned that dark magic had corrupted the forest, and as such, dark magic was needed to bind the ritual.[10]           Akara grieves for Liene    Akara later travelled to the Sanguine Ruins, where she found Liene, either dead, or dying. When the hero(es) returned after slaying the Blood Rose, they found Akara grieving over Liene's body. Bitterly reflecting on the deaths of Hemlir, Liene, and dozens of sisters, Akara declared that they couldn't allow their sacrifices to be in vain. The hero(es) told her that while the Blood Rose was dead, Lakrii had sacrificed herself to the creature, and in doing so, had fully revived the Countess. Akara declared that she had to be slain, as such an evil could not be allowed to possess the power of the Worldstone. Intoning the deeds of the heroes she had encountered five years prior, she told the new hero(es) that like the ones before them, they would have to travel to the Forgotten Tower, join with Kashya and the Rogues making their attack, and slay the Countess.[11]  In-game[] Diablo II[]   Akara       Akara, High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye     Appears in  Diablo II     Significance  Minor     Service(s)  gossip, Quest initiation     Residence(s)  Rogue Encampment     Starts quest(s)  Den of Evil (quest), Search for Cain (quest)     Portrayed by  Eve Brent    Akara is located at the Rogue Encampment in Act I of Diablo II.

I welcome you, traveler, to our camp, but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor shelter within these rickety walls.You see, our ancient Sisterhood has fallen under a strange curse. The mighty Citadel from which we have guarded the gates to the East for generations, has been corrupted by the evil Demoness, Andariel.I still can't believe it... but she turned many of our sister Rogues against us and drove us from our ancestral home. Now the last defenders of the Sisterhood are either dead or scattered throughout the wilderness.I implore you, stranger. Please help us. Find a way to lift this terrible curse and we will pledge our loyalty to you for all time. Show quote Sorceress Greetings, young Sorceress. It is good to see more of your kind at work in the world these dark days. In my opinion, the world needs more women to fight against the great shadow. But I am forgetting my manners...I am Akara, High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I welcome you, traveler, to our camp, but I'm afraid I can offer you but poor shelter within these rickety walls.You see, our ancient Sisterhood has fallen under a strange curse. The mighty Citadel from which we have guarded the gates to the East for generations, has been corrupted by the evil Demoness, Andariel.I still can't believe it... but she turned many of our sister Rogues against us and drove us from our ancestral home. Now the last defenders of the Sisterhood are either dead or scattered throughout the wilderness.I implore you, stranger: please help us. Find a way to lift this terrible curse and we will pledge our loyalty to you for all time. Gossip[] Show quote Deckard Cain I understand that Cain is the last descendant of the ancient Horadrim and that his knowledge of their lore is vast. He could prove to be very useful in discerning the nature of our current crisis. Show quote Kashya Kashya has always been fiercely loyal, but I fear her anger and frustration over these recent events will lead her into harm's way. She is highly protective of the few Rogues remaining under her command and will not send them into combat unless there is dire need. Show quote Charsi Charsi is young and innocent. However, I believe her Barbarian blood thrills to the prospect of adventure and danger. She takes great pride in her work and finds comfort in the fact that her weapons and armor are helping to end this evil plague. Show quote Warriv Though he has only been our guest for a short time, I sense that Warriv has faced many harrowing trials. Though he knows, as I do, that a terrible evil has blanketed the land, his only real concern is to reach the eastern trading ports with his caravan. Show quote Gheed To be honest, I have done my best to stay clear of Gheed. He wears dishonesty about himself like a cloak and seeks only to better his situation by preying on the misfortunes of others. Show quote Evil The wilderness is overrun with Evil and the minions of Hell have taken our rightful home. We must purge all Evil from the Monastery and restore order to the world. Show quote Sightless Eye I often dream of the day we reclaim our own. The Sightless Eye sees through the mist of time a great glory ahead, but how far ahead the Eye cannot discern. Show quote Mental discipline Our mental discipline is matched only by our skill in archery... I only hope these are enough to withstand this awful trial. Show quote Corruption Beware that you do not suffer the fate of the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's life is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul is even worse. Show quote Corrupted Rogues Even though the corrupted ones were once of our Order, you need not shy from slaying them, for they stand between you and Andariel.Perhaps, when the Demon Queen is dead, our Sisters will return to life, but more likely they will be forever bound to their unholy pact. Show quote Ambition (Sorceress) The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has a long and distinguished history. Over the generations our Order has become a deadly fighting force as well as a bastion for women who sought to forge their own destiny.Yet beware, young one, the lure of power and knowledge can lead to disaster. I have seen ambition foul the bravest of hearts and recklessness dull hard-won wisdom.You would do well to tread lightly upon the dark path you have chosen to explore. Den of Evil[] Show quote Quest Initiation There is a place of great evil in the wilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures and horrors from beyond the grave.I fear that these creatures are massing for an attack against our encampment. If you are sincere about helping us, find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts.May the Great Eye watch over you. Show quote After Initiate I should add that many Rogue scouts have died in that horrible place. We cannot afford to lose any more. If you choose to enter that Den of Evil, you must do so alone. Show quote Early Return Your task is not complete until you have killed all the demons in that cave. Show quote Upon Completion You have cleansed the Den of Evil. You've earned my trust and may yet restore my faith in humanity.Your reward is training in the skill of your choice. Sister's Burial Grounds[] Show quote After Initiate Blood Raven fought valiantly against Diablo in the catacombs beneath Tristram... She was never quite the same afterwards. It is now obvious she brought an evil influence back with her. Show quote Early Return If you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear that our Order will perish forever. Show quote Upon Completion Andariel must be made to pay for her sacrilege! Search for Cain[] Show quote Quest Initiation It is clear that we are facing an Evil difficult to comprehend, let alone combat.There is only one Horadrim sage, schooled in the most arcane history and lore, who could advise us... His name is Deckard Cain.You must go to Tristram and find him, my friend. I pray that he still lives. Show quote After Initiate Tristram is too far to journey by foot... Cain would likely be dead, when you arrived. However, there is a magical portal that will take you there instantly.To open it, one must stand within the circle of Cairn Stones and touch them in a certain order. The proper order can be found in the runes written on the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.You must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss and bring back its bark. I will translate the runes to unlock the Stones' mystic pattern. Show quote Early Return How will you find Cain without going to Tristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is the first step on your journey. Show quote After Finding the Scroll Ah, very good. I have translated the runes on this scroll. You must find the Cairn Stones and touch them in the order that I have written. Show quote After Entering Tristram If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram before all is lost! Show quote Upon Completion You have risked your life to rescue Cain. For that we thank you.We must seek his counsel immediately. The Forgotten Tower[] Show quote After Initiate The dangers there are not solely architectural. Once inside that wretched place, many succumb to a vile miasma. Show quote Early Return There is no more I can tell you about that ancient tower. Show quote Upon Completion I thought the stories of treasure in the tower were nothing but lies. I am glad you found something of value in that death-trap. Would that our Sisters had been so fortunate. Tools of the Trade[] Show quote After Initiate The retrieval of the Horadric Malus is not without risk. Our Monastery is filled with voracious hellspawn. You'd best be careful, my friend. Show quote Early Return If you can't carry out this quest, how will you face the greater evils ahead? Show quote Upon Completion Well done, my friend. But remember, the return of the Horadric Malus is but one step in reclaiming the Monastery. Sisters to the Slaughter[] Show quote After Initiate Andariel has desecrated all we hold dear. She must not be permitted to serve Diablo.Destroy her! Her corruption of our Order must be undone! Show quote Early Return You have done much to help us, but I sense that this has only fueled Andariel's fury. She will not stop until we are all dead.You must kill Andariel before her army can gain the upper hand. Show quote Upon Completion Finally, we may rejoice!We owe you a debt we can never repay. I only hope that in time we will be able to rebuild our Order.All our thanks go with you, my friend. Gossip about Akara[] Some of the other locals give their thoughts concerning Akara.  Show quote Charsi Akara, our priestess and seer, is most upset by the corruption of our Sisters. I fear that she blames herself. Show quote Gheed Akara and Kashya are Sisters in the Order of the Sightless Eye, but they are worlds apart. Akara is a slow river of magic, and Kashya, a viper of war. They're both deeply devoted to their religious order, yet the corruption of their Sisters pains them both to no end. Show quote Kashya Akara has been like a mother to me for as long as I can remember. She is wise and good, but I don't think she has the steel to retake our Monastery by force. Show quote Warriv Akara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She sells the few magic items in her possession and can even heal your wounds. She is very wise and will help you if she can. Diablo Immortal[] Akara is an NPC in Diablo Immortal. She is found at the Rogue Battlecamp, introduced during the \"The Horadric Bestiary\" quest, and is later encountered in the Sanguine Ruins at the end of \"Blood Resurrection.\"  Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.

It was he who would develop the faith that would give rise to the Zakarum church. By all accounts, Akarat was kind, generous, and unassuming, and exuded selflessness and compassion.[1]    Contents  1 Biography  1.1 The Coming of Yaerius 1.2 Word of the Prophet 1.3 Legacy   2 In-game 3 References    Biography[] The Coming of Yaerius[]  \"And Yaerius appeared unto Akarat and showed him the Light that illuminates all souls with its blessed power. So long as we trust in this sacred force, we shall have strength everlasting and falter not in our trials.\"  - Excerpt from a mystic’s account of the life of Akarat(src)    According to historical accounts, Akarat was a wandering ascetic from Xiansai. Having become disillusioned with society and its incessant conflicts, he joined the ranks of a humble meditative order that sought enlightenment and peace. One night, while deep in meditation, he envisioned a spectacular flash of light and energy cascading across the sky.[1] According to most accounts, this was the coming of an angel named Yaerius,[2] or \"son of light\" in Akarat's native language.[1] It is said that Yaerius revealed to Akarat the tenets of what was to become the Zakarum faith. These teachings stressed the necessity of resisting all things evil, and embracing, with total devotion, the Light. The angel appointed Akarat to be the prophet of these new teachings, and bade him take the word to the people of all lands.[2] A theory postulated by Deckard Cain diverged from this account however. He believed that Akarat had instead seen an echo of Uldyssian's sacrifice at the end of the Sin War, as there had been reports of mystics with similar experiences. Thus he theorized that while in meditation, Akarat had seen the same phenomenon and attributed it to a being named Yaerius, which meant \"Son of Light\" in his native language.[1] Whatever the truth behind the matter, Akarat came from the experience with a belief that humans were powerful vessels of light, and that all should seek their \"inner light\" in order to live good lives.[3]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Word of the Prophet[] Moved by what he'd seen, Akarat set out on a grand journey to the cities of Kehjistan, intent on enlightening his fellow men about the divine Light he claimed existed within everyone.[1] He claimed that his words were not new, that the Ancients had also embraced the Light.[4] Over time, a number of local disciples flocked to his side.[1]  Legacy[]  \"Akarat...why...why have you abandoned us?\"  - Elder Owen(src)             A possible carving of Akarat    Akarat disappeared in the jungles of Kehjistan. While his teachings had left their mark, they would flounder in obscurity for a millennium. It was not until Emperor Tassara's codification of the Zakarum faith that it became an actual church, and subsequently, the dominant religious force on Sanctuary.[5] Shortly afterwards, when the Sons of Rakkis were sent to bring the Light to the West, the Crusaders traveled east on what was rumored to be the path Akarat took before his disappearance.[3] People may pray to Akarat at times,[6] along with giving thanks.[7] Zebulon I claimed to have received visions from Akarat when he initiated his reform of the Zakarum faith.[5] The Paladin Akarat was named after the ascetic.[8]  In-game[] In Diablo III, several Legendary items bear Akarat's name, including the Relic of Akarat Templar Relic and the Akarat's Awakening Crusader Shield. The Akarat's Champion ability also exists.  References[]  ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 Book of Cain  ↑ Jump up to: 2.0 2.1 Zakarum Zealot, The Arreat Summit.

Originally, the skill itself allowed the Crusader a second chance upon taking fatal damage in earlier versions of the game, gave him/her a significant bonus to attack speed, and the Rally rune had a chance on attack to reduce remaining cooldowns by 1 second. As of patch 2.0.5, the former effect was moved to the Prophet rune, the second effect moved to Hasteful rune (replacing the movement speed bonus) and the latter effect was greatly weakened.

This skill (with Prophet rune) is one of the two ways to be saved from dying by an active skill, the other being Self Sacrifice.

Knowing that power could lead to corruption, even for the best-intentioned of individuals like Kion, she ordered that Akeba ensure that the Immortals never wavered or faltered in their duty.[1] Should Kion ever falter through complancy or pride, Akeba was ordered to remove him and take the Eternal Crown, after which someone would watch over her, as she had her brother.[2]    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/96/AkebaShadows.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220510121659\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"AkebaShadows\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/96/AkebaShadows.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220510121659\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"76\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"AkebaShadows.jpg\" data-image-key=\"AkebaShadows.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/9/96/AkebaShadows.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220510121659\"></a>       Akeba forms the Shadows    Working in secret, Akeba found those brave enough to help her constantly test and challenge the Immortals. They would look for cracks and weaknesses and they would do everything they could to make sure the elite defenders of Sanctuary were always up to the task. She called this group the Shadows.[1] Events went awry for the Immortals when they fought against a party of demons, including Rakanoth.[3] The outcome of this battle is unclear, but Akeba later fought Rakanoth and the remaining demons amidst the corpses of the Immortals. Here, she emerged triumphant.[1] Eventually, Akeba led the Shadows against the Immortals, overthrew them, and took the Eternal Crown. This made Akeba the next Immortal. Knowing that she could not rest on her laurels however, Akeba created the Cycle of Strife, where the Shadows would continuously test the Immortals.[4]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Recent History[]  \"You think you have what it takes to walk this path?

Around 1270, he led the Cult of Terror to besiege Stormpoint after a shard of the Worldstone had been divined to be on the island. As they could not divine the precise location of the shard, he ordered them to storm the island with demonic reinforcements, killing any opposition they encounter and using the survivors for haruspex. At a point, he invited the Bride of Hell to inspect his progress, but was interrupted by scrying on their location. Unfortunately the strangers got away.[1] Impatient with the progress of the search, he summoned the Howling Terror to hunt the shard from the skies.[2] The cult made a base in the Planks, and Akinees resided in a Tidal Cavern beneath the base. Here, captured villagers from the Shanties were delivered to him for sacrifice. Unfortunately the Shard-seeker found him and was able to drive him off.[3] Unknown to the Shard-seeker, Akinees kept track of their progress through divination. Once they retrieved the shard from the Warden's pet, he sent cultists to attack children under the Shard-seeker's protection. Using that distraction, he stole the shard and portaled away.[4]         GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     In-game[]   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/6/67/Akinees_Portrait.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230108102828\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Akinees Portrait\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/6/67/Akinees_Portrait.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230108102828\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"102\" height=\"108\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Akinees Portrait.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Akinees_Portrait.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/6/67/Akinees_Portrait.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230108102828\"></a>       Dialogue box portrait of Akinees    Akinees is the first boss of Stormpoint Keep in Diablo Immortal.

More beast than man, really...a wild thing with eyes clouded by emotion and intuition and all those other fleeting feelings that change on a whim just as swiftly as the winds. Are you that boy, or are you a monk?\"  - Akyev to Zhota(src)    Zhota was one of the disciples Akyev taught. He was assigned to teach the boy by the Patriarchs, after Zhota chose Ymil as his patron deity, hoping that Akyev's rigid demenor would temper Zhota's hesitent nature, and vice versa. When he first encountered him, he snapped Zhota's flute in half and tossed it out of the Floating Sky Monastery. They would spar together in the monestary's training grouns, Akyev wielding a scimitar he had forged himself against Zhota's bo. He easily defeated him, cutting into his staff, and commented that Zhota had \"too much of the rivers in him,\" touching on his disdain for Ymil. He would forbid Zhota from ever fixing the blemish, lest he forget the lessons imparted to him. Over the years, Akyev worked feverishly to suppress his pupil's insistence on trusting in himself when presented with difficult situations. Whether or not Zhota' insights were correct didn't matter to Akyev. He believed such reliance on the self would compromise one's ability to obey the Patriarchs' commands and prosecute their divine will. Zhota was eventually annointed as a Monk, but Akyev carried doubts as to whether he was truly ready.[1]  The Gorgorra[]  \"You know the boy is not a demon.\"\"\"I know what the Patriarch has told me. I do not question him\"\"The caravan...You killed those people.\"\"I did my duty.\"  - Zhota and Akyev discuss the latter's actions(src)    A few weeks after Zhota became a Monk, and the day after the sighting of the Fallen Star, Zhota was summoned to Akyev's side in the monastery. Akyev sent Zhota into the Gorgorra, ordering that his disciple examine all travelers within the forest, but remain wary, lest they be tainted by gods of chaos. Those touched by those gods were to be \"purified,\" he ordered, relaying the decree of the Patriarchs. He departed the monestary on his own mission the next day, in order to find a demon wearing the skin of a child. He came across a caravan that had been transporting him and, after they cursed the names of the Patriarchs, slaughtered them all. He even hired bandits to find his quarry. He later encountered Zhota in the forest, finding him alongside Mishka. The child that he'd sought. He commented that Zhota had succeeded where he'd failed, giving his former student praise for the first time. He told Zhota that Mishka was a demon wearing the skin of a child. Mishka called Akyev the demon—lies to hide its true identity, according to Akyev. He recounted Mishka's tale, that he was the son of one of the Patriarchs and his concubine. He'd been born with deformities, but his mother had convinced his father to sequester him in the palace instead of killing him. Mishka had lived in isolation until the coming of the Fallen Star, causing paronoia to sweep Ivgorod. In this climate, Zhota summized that the Patriarch had ordered that Mishka be put to death, lest his purity be called into question. Thus, through the work of his mother and a few loyal servants, he was carried into the Gorgorra. Akyev was unmoved—these were lies that the demon had told him. Zhota stated that he believed Mishka, causing Akyev to deliver a roundhouse kick into Zhota, winding him. Akyev disgustedly commented that Zhota was still a boy, and gave him a second kick as Zhota claimed that the Patriarch Akyev served was no longer interested in maintaining the balance between order and chaos. He scraped off the circles embodied on Zhota's forehead, stating that Zhota was no Monk. He ordered him to return to the monastery and await judgement. The two engaged in combat, Zhota once again wielding his bo against Akyev's scimitar. Akyev gained the upperhand, and was unmoved by Zhota's accusations of his brutality. For a moment, Akyev seemed to consider that Zhota was correct, that he'd been sent to kill an innocent. But only for a moment, as he swung his sword.  The sword was swung, but Zhota grabbed it, breaking the weapon in two. Zhota used the broken blade to decapitate his master. He then built a pyre to cremate his master's body. He took some solace in the knowledge that the Patriarch wouldn't be able to find another Monk like Akyev—one who could slaughter innocents without hesitation.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Personality and Traits[]  \"When the ill wind blows, the tree that bends will break.\"  - A mantra often recited by Akyev(src)    By all accounts, Akyev was one of the strictest and unforgiving members of his order. Many initiates have been gravely injured (and, according to rumor, even died), due to his brutal training methods.[2] Zaim was his patron god, and he regards the god Ymil as being capricious and indesciscive. Unlike many of his fellows, he had no love of the arts, such as music. He believed in the concept of a Monk treating a weapon as a natural extension of their body. He never flinched from any task given to him. His fanaticism and willingness to do anything to achieve an objective given to him by the Patriarchs marked him as an oddity amongst the order. Likewise, unlike other teachers, he did not attempt to foster friendships with his students. His beard was black, without any gray.[1]  References[]  ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 1.2 Unyielding  ↑ Book of Tyrael"},{"pageTitle":"Al'maiesh","pageContent":"Auriel using Al'maiesh    Al'maiesh, the Cord of Hope, is the chosen weapon of Auriel.

The demon Nereza promised to restore their power but instead turned them into misshapen creatures and sent them to war against us. We may die, but not before she is sent back to the Burning Hells.\"  - Alaric(src)    A nephalem, Alaric was active during the early days of Sanctuary, after Inarius had altered the Worldstone to diminish the nephalem's abilities. As a result, the nephalem's children were born weak with short lifespans. Alaric and his kin turned to the demon Nereza, who promised to restore their power. Instead, she turned them into her servants and sent them to war against Alaric and his followers.[1]  Alaric declared that his people could survive the coming battle, but Edric \"saw the truth in his eyes.\" He sent Edric and other warriors to guard the Beacon of Honor at Warrior's Rest.[2] In the end, Neraza's minions slaughtered Alaric and his people. Even in death, reduced to ghosts, Alaric and his kin continued to wage war.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Ghosts[]  \"Are you nephalem?\"\"No. There have been no nephalem for a millenium.\"\"Huh. Another myth.\"  - Alaric and Leah(src)             Alaric    Thousands of years after the Sin War, Alaric maintained his guardianship over the Drowned Temple. It was here that he was eventually visited by Leah and the Nephalem, who sought to enter the temple to retrieve the second shard of the sword El'druin, a shard of which has awakened the ancient Nephalem spirits, driving them to madness. Amused at Leah's ignorance of his kind and (surprisingly) untouched by the sword's effects, Alaric told them that only a nephalem could enter the temple, but told the group to fetch keys to enter the temple from its outlying tombs. The heroes succeeded, and Alaric directed them to enter the tomb and defeat his fellow guardians. The heroes succeeded, and Alaric commented that the Nephalem's strength rivaled that of their greatest champions, realizing that the hero(es) was/were indeed nephalem, even if they didn't know it. Regardless, he granted the group access to the temple's most sacred ground, where they were able to retrieve the shard they sought.[1]  In-game[] Alaric appears as an NPC in Diablo III. He guides the player(s) in \"The Broken Blade\" quest. Later in game, Leah may ask The Nephalem about if they think it is true. In various forms, all six classes reply that, with all due respect, Alaric must be mistaken. Ironically, it was Alaric who has given this title to the heroes, and most in-game characters address to the Nephalem subsequently.

Biography[] Albrecht accompanied his family when they came to Tristram, from where Leoric would govern Khanduras. Leoric noted that Albrecht appeared to enjoy his new home.[1] As the Darkening of Tristram progressed, Diablo attempted to claim the king's body, but was not strong enough to fully take possession. The demon required a host, simple and innocent, and thus found Albrecht to be fitting.           Diablo possesses Albrecht    Albrecht was captured by the traitorous Archbishop Lazarus and was taken down into the depths of the catacombs of the Tristram Cathedral. Diablo's shattered soulstone was driven into Albrecht's forehead, and the Demon's vile spirit entered his body and eventually twisted the boy's body into an approximation of his true form.[2] A group of heroes—a Vizjerei sorcerer, Blood Raven the Rogue captain, and Albrecht's brother, Prince Aidan—entered the darkened monastery in an attempt to find and rescue the Prince. Lazarus was encountered and defeated at the Unholy Altar, but the adventurers only found a different child, sacrificed by Lazarus as an offering.[3]           Aidan took Diablo's soulstone from Albrecht             Albrecht freed from Diablo's grasp    Unwilling to give up hope, the heroes sought out, encountered, and eventually vanquished the Lord of Terror himself. Diablo let out a tortured scream of death, which went all the way up to the mortal realm, shattering the windows of the cathedral. In his dreams, Deckard Cain could have sworn that he heard a child's scream in the midst of the terrible roar.[4] Kneeling down beside the defeated Prime Evil, Aidan used a small blade to remove the soulstone from Diablo's forehead. Diablo's body transformed back into that of Prince Albrecht, who then gasped his final breaths.[5]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.

The Nephalem managed to rescue surviving prisoners of the cult, before taking Maghda's life.[2] In the aftermath, the Imperial Guard were dispatched to the Dahlgur Oasis, in order to procure (new) slaves.[4] Decades after Malthael's attempted genocide, people still lived in Alcarnus.

This Set is designed for the Druid, however any class can wear the items in this set except for Aldur's Stony Gaze. Only the Druid can complete this set.

Like other Barbarian cannibals, Aletur has very high melee damage, huge Life pool and moves very quickly. In addition, he has Leap skill that deals damage upon landing, and summons multiple Pack Hunter wolves at his side in the beginning of combat. He has no monster affixes, though.

He is an alchemist, similar to Lysander in personality and wares. Alkor's shop is at the top of the map, where he sells various potions. He is also very fond of necromancers. Apparently, he has a number of odd potions, claiming that Asheara is a good customer as she buys a \"potion of manliness\" from him every week, although the latter is most likely Alkor's rude sense of humor. He also claims to have a library of  tomes. The pharmaceutical tomes would make sense for an alchemist, while the rest concern religious texts, which explains why Alkor is familiar with Lam Esen's Tome.

I don't like to be disturbed while I'm studying! Show quote Necromancer Damn it, I wish you people would just leave me alone! I...Oh, you're a Necromancer, aren't you? I've heard that your kind use powerful potions and such to wake the dead and control spirits. I'd love to discuss what components you use some time.I am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in potions and salves, myself, and I can sell you some if you really need them....Feel free to drop by anytime. Gossip[] Show quote Grimoire Care to take a gander at my Grimoire? Show quote Potions I've never claimed that you'd live forever after trying one of my potions! Merely that you might look as though you had. Show quote Library I keep a library of tomes - heretical, exegetical, hermeneutical and pharmaceutical. Show quote Badgering I hope you don't object to my badgering the witless. Show quote Meshif You came here with Meshif? That old 'tour-guide to the stupid'!I'm surprised you made it here in one piece. Show quote Asheara Oh, Asheara's a good customer. She buys a potion of manliness from me every week. Show quote Hratli Hratli's only good for making his silly magic weapons. It's not like he's got the stones to actually go out and use them on anything. Show quote Ormus Oh, Ormus has been talking in riddles for years. I think he does it to cover up the fact that he's got nothing intelligent to say. Show quote Natalya Yes, Natalya is a cute girl. However, I think she could use a special potion. Let me see here, 'Radiant Beauty'? No. 'Ray of Sunshine'? No, that's not it. Ah, here it is, 'Relax Frosty Bitch'. This should help her out. Show quote Evil (Necromancer) Even I can tell that the evil in the jungle is growing. I hope you survive out there, my pasty friend. I'd still like to discuss what components are best used in necromantic potions. Show quote Golden Bird (Cut) There was a very fat man here recently asking after the Golden Bird of Ku Y'Leh. Have you heard of it? He kept muttering about ashes. I would imagine one Golden Bird's ash-hole to be about the same as another, wouldn't you? The Golden Bird[] Show quote Quest Initiation Many alchemists believe that Ku Y'leh's magical elixirs bonded with his body before his death. His ashes are, therefore, considered to be very rare, highly potent alchemical ingredients. If I could procure the ashes, I would create a potion which could defy death itself! Show quote After Initiate Remember, Ku Y'leh's ashes are stored within the statuette of the Golden Bird. The bird is worth a great deal to the one who can locate it. Show quote Early Return Who has not dreamt of immortality? One man is rumored to have done more than merely dream. Find the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh, and you might find the secret to everlasting life. Show quote With Golden Bird Ah, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh.  Thank you, my friend.Busy yourself while I experiment with the ashes within it. Then, return and see what I have made for you. Show quote Upon Completion From the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed for you a potion. Lam Esen's Tome[] Show quote Quest Initiation It pains me to waste time with you, so I'll get right to the point.There is a very special book which you must find for me. It was written long ago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who studied Skatsimi magic and the effects of the Prime Evils on the mortal world. The Black Book was lost when the Children of Zakarum took over this land.Now, you must reclaim it without delay! Its knowledge may aid us in this dark time ahead. Show quote After Initiate The Black Book contains powerful secrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, long eclipsed by Zakarum.I should warn you. The Black Book is much sought after by both good and evil. Be wary. Show quote Early Return Did I neglect to mention that the book contains useful information about the Prime Evils? Show quote Upon Completion You have found the Book! It should give all of us here some insight into the nature of the Prime Evils...Ah, but as for you... Blade of the Old Religion[] Show quote After Initiate Have you not heard of the Gidbinn? Well, allow me to reduce your ignorance on the subject.The Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a religious artifact greatly valued by the Old Religion, Skatsim. Show quote Early Return Legend has it that the Skatsimi priests placed great power within the small blade. Power enough to repel this terrible jungle-curse which encroaches on our sanctuary. Show quote Upon Completion Hah! You have stolen the fabled blade from right under Zakarum's nose! This is a great day, indeed! The Blackened Temple[] Show quote After Initiate (Black Book) The Black Book contains some vague prophecies regarding this undertaking. I'm not so sure it will turn out well for you. Show quote After Initiate I am but a potion dealer and an avid reader of occult books. What do I know of the Travincal? Show quote Early Return (Black Book) Kill as many as you can. I have a morbid love of excess. Show quote Early Return If only we could have found the Black Book. I feel as though a malevolent hand has led us away from it. Show quote Upon Completion You've accomplished the impossible! By killing the Council, the curse of Zakarum will be lifted and our land will be free!Oh. Thank you! The Guardian[] Show quote After Initiate (Black Book) The hidden ways of the Tower are long forgotten. Though, it is rumored to have been built as far below the ground as above it. Show quote After Initiate We have seen Diablo, but remain unsure of his Brothers' whereabouts. Show quote Early Return (Black Book) Well, the good news is that events are unfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. The bad news is that the story ends in our utter ruin! Show quote Early Return I'm afraid both fear and a large dose of elixir preclude me from answering. Show quote Upon Completion Your news is great indeed. You have saved us all. I would smile, but I'm afraid my face might collapse. Gossip about Alkor[] Some of the other locals give their thoughts concerning Alkor.  Show quote Hratli Alkor is a potion dealer given over to a life steeped in ceaseless study and dissipation. Show quote Meshif I went to speak with old Alkor, but I disturbed his studies. He doesn't seem to like visitors. Show quote Ormus Alkor is able to explain things much more clearly than Ormus. Personality and Traits[] Alkor is loathe to be interrupted or disturbed, but if one manages to get his attention, he does his best to aid them for as long as his battered wits allow him to remain focused. He is interested in Necromancers,[1] and maintains a grimoire, along with a library of tomes—heretical, exegetical, hermeneutical, and pharmaceutical.[2]  Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.  Alkor has a very strong Indian accent, making him rather unique and raising questions as to where Indian accent exists in the world of Sanctuary. Alkor's line \"I hope you don't object to my badgering the witless\" is a pun on the legal concept of badgering the witness.

He ran the company for thirteen years. In the last few years of his time at Blizzard, he was both running the company and overseeing development of World of Warcraft as lead game designer. Exhausted by 6-7 day weeks, Adham left Blizzard just after WOW was released to start a hedge fund, using artificial intelligence to trade the stock market (Adham has commented that this was another \"video game\" for him). About one to two years into the job, Adham came to regret his decision, missing work on working on videogame work. However, it gave him a good work-life balance. He returned to Blizzard in 2016.[2]  Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.  Adham's first game was Pong.

Alma Negra tends to be more of an offensive-heavy than defensive-heavy shield. Particularly notable is its bonuses to Attack Rating and Damage, both of which can be very high for a shield. When combined with Offensive Auras such as Conviction or Fanaticism, the Alma Negra can be a big help for Paladins inclined to be more physical fighters. Defensively, however, Alma Negra is just a bit lacking. It does not give any bonuses to resistances, which could be harmful in Nightmare or Hell difficulties. Similarly, its Chance to Block is lower than other shields. Alma Negra is still a useful shield, especially for Paladins such as Zealots. Some may choose to help remedy the resistance problem by socketing it and then inserting a Perfect Diamond or Um Rune.

It has an unsettling aura. Home to power thought to be extinct from Sanctuary, the Altar of Rites will bestow these mystic forces upon worthy nephalem...after a sacrifice is offered.[1] It is implied that the altar has a collective intelligence.[2]  History[] The altar dates back to Sanctuary's ancient past. It was rediscovered during/after the End of Days amid a hunting/mining expedition from New Tristram,[1][2] which was searching for ancient nephalem artifacts. They dug out the altar, but as they did so, a faint whisper infiltrated one of the miners' thoughts; not one voice, but a collective. The miner didn't know who these voices were, but was certain that they had to share their discovery. They hauled the altar back to New Tristram. A few days passed, many townsfolk came to view the altar, then left. Then, the Nephalem marched into town and requested to see the altar.[2] Shaken to their core by the eldritch aroma of the monolith, the citizens enlisted the assistance of brave nephalem willing to investigate. To unlock the powers of the altar, the nephalem had to travel all over Sanctuary. They also had to deal with scores of demons hellbent on preventing them from acquiring the altar's full power.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     Gameplay[]        Map marker    The altar was introduced in the PTR for Season 28. Players can begin interacting with the Altar of Rites at level 1. Upon arrival at the Altar of Rites, players will see 26 icons called Seals and three Legendary Potion Powers. After unlocking the first Seal, the order in which a player unlock additional Seals and obtains their powers is at their discretion. Once a Seal or Legendary Potion Power is unlocked, players will immediately receive that Seal or Potion's power and will have the ability to unlock connected Seals or Potions once they have the required materials. All Seals and Potions can be unlocked by players and the powers apply to all of their characters.

Unlocking Seals[]          Altar of Rites interface    Players must gather materials listed in the Altar of Rites menu and sacrifice them in order to gain a Seal or Potion's power. In addition to receiving the power after unlocking, players will notice the generic text previously displayed has been swapped with a small story scrap about Sanctuary's tumultuous past. To unlock a Seal, the Seal preceding it must first be unlocked—this does not apply to Seals R, S, and T because of how they’re positioned within the Altar. For example, if a player wants to unlock Seal B or C, Seal A must first be unlocked. There is also no limit to how many Seals or Potions can be unlocked within a given time period, if a player has the required materials to sacrifice to the Altar. Regardless of the order in which Seals and Potions are unlocked, the cost will increase as shown below.

Knowing that he would want to find a way off the island, Alunthe told a passing adventurer to warn the nearby port town of an impending attack, while he tries to hold Sargoth and his minions back.

However, they didn't get far before they were attacked by more Bloodsworn. The cultists were slain, but while Alyssa wasn't wounded physically, her emotional wounds were weighing her down. She explained how one of the Bloodsworn women had taunted her, as if she was nothing...and now, she was the only survivor of her village. The hero(es) reassured Alyssa that she wasn't worthless, and that the Bloodsworn would pay for what they did. But for that to happen, they had to find Kashya.           Alyssa's body    It was at this moment that vines erupted from the ground, incapacitating Alyssa. More Bloodsworn attacked, but they were repelled, in part due to Kashya and her fellow Rogues.

And I fear she has taken a piece of you with her... a beast born from your own blood.\"  - Discussion between Nafain and the Wanderer(src)    In order to find the burial site of Astaroth's soulstone, Lilith payed the druid Nafain a visit. Playing on his hatred of the Pale Knights, she made a pact with him, and agreed to wipe out the Knight Penitent at Cerrigar; Nafain's hometown. In a means to kill two birds with one stone she cut the druid in two, and bound his torso to a tree in the moors at Daudur Peats. The tree corrupted his body and prevented him from dying from blood loss. His blood flowed through area, corrupting and or killing the flora and fauna within its reach. Lilith channeled the blood and corruption to a nearby cave, where they began to gestate into the amalgam. The Wanderer disrupted the gestation before it was completed. Fortunately, it was almost completed and the Amalgam of Rage emerged, with bone and sinew partly exposed. After it was injured by the Wanderer in a short battle, Lilith recalled it.[1] Lilith led the beast to attack Eldhaime Keep. After tearing right through its defenders, Lilith led it to Astaroth's soulstone beneath the keep.[2] When Astaroth was freed, the Amalgam was gifted to him as a mount. She then took them to Cerrigar. This was to make Astaroth fight harder to consume his host, and to complete her pact with Nafain. The amalgam, with Astaroth as its rider, decimated most of the knights at Cerrigar (and the rest of the town). It was later killed along with its rider by the Wanderer.[3]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     References[]  ↑ Diablo IV,Act 2,Fangs of Corruption  ↑ Diablo IV,Act 2,In Ruins  ↑ Diablo IV,Act 2,As the World Burns"},{"pageTitle":"Amalgamated Dreg","pageContent":"An Amalgamated Dreg    Amalgamated Dregs are a type of aberration demon seen in Diablo Immortal.

The voice acting provided to the Amazon class in Diablo II and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, is done by the voice actor Jessica Straus. Straus has also done other voice acting work for Blizzard Entertainment, including Warcraft III and World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. The Amazon Cassia is playable in Heroes of the Storm. An Amazon skin for Nova has also been implemented into the game.[1] The Amazon was considered for inclusion in Diablo III as per the game's 'hero pack' model, but was passed over in favor of the Necromancer.[2] Out of the five original characters in Diablo II, the Amazon was the first to be developed to completion.[3] The developers wanted to work on a \"hot chick\" as their first class, hence the results. The original design was done by Kris Renkewitz. She sketched a tall, fearsome woman who wore bracers that coiled down her arms, animal-skin boots, and mummy-like wrappings that covered her most intimate parts, leaving the rest of her skin exposed. Her hair was short and spiky, her visage grim and feral. She was, in Renkewitz's mind, an \"amazon.\" However, Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer, and David Brevik reacted negatively to the \"Xena-like appearance.\" The class was redesigned by Phil Shenk.[4] Gallery[] <img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/1/1f/Amazon.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/123?cb=20060901173618\" title=\"Amazon.jpg (18 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Amazon\" data-image-name=\"Amazon.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Amazon.jpg\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/d/d2/Wall07.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20090503174700\" title=\"Wall07.jpg (44 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Wall07\" data-image-name=\"Wall07.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Wall07.jpg\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/2/23/Wall10.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20090503174611\" title=\"Wall10.jpg (58 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Wall10\" data-image-name=\"Wall10.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Wall10.jpg\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/8/82/Wall11.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20090503174908\" title=\"Wall11.jpg (60 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Wall11\" data-image-name=\"Wall11.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Wall11.jpg\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/2/24/D2amazon.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20110429153817\" title=\"D2amazon.jpg (72 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"The Amazon using Immolation Arrow\" data-image-name=\"D2amazon.jpg\" data-image-key=\"D2amazon.jpg\" data-caption=\"The Amazon using Immolation Arrow\">The Amazon using Immolation Arrow References[]  ↑ 2015-05-20, New Heroes of the Storm skins spotted in launch video.

Members of the caste are called \"Amazons,\" though this is a term that is also used to describe the Askari as a whole.

I've heard about your people... nomadic warriors without peer.\"  - Asheara(src)             An Amazon armed with a bow    In Askari culture, only women serve as warriors, as their lithe bodies and superior dexterity are better suited than men for the dense jungles of their homeland. Amazon warriors are known for their deftness, superior hand-to-eye coordination, and the ferocity of their attacks. In the jungles of their homeland, Amazons are adept at the tactics of misdirection, and can even draw on the jungle to support themselves. The jungle itself can be a hindrance though, and early in training, Amazon warriors are taught how to overcome these conditions. Indeed, all Askarri are taught how to hunt and fight during the night of the jungles. Intense training and stern discipline make Amazon warriors formiddable foes. Their agility and combination of magical and martial prowess make them flexible and adept opponents in battle.[2] Specific training is carried out to help Amazon warriors avoid potentially devastating blows. Through strict martial discipline and focus, an Amazon warrior can attune herself to her environment and the dangers around her, allowing her to react to these hazards with superhuman agility. One aspect of this ability is her knack for avoiding missile fire.[3]           An Amazon armed with a spear    On the martial side, Amazon warriors are highly regarded with their skill with the bow, their ability rivaled only by the Sisters of the Sightless Eye. Unlike the Sisterhood though, Amazons are also adept in the use of the spear and other such weapons. In regards to magic, Amazons can wield prime and holy magic.  Some Amazons take upon the path of the healer, a worthy path due to the toxicity of many native plant species in their homeland. They may also be blessed by their deities should they prove worthy.[2]  Tales of the Amazons' almost supernatural skills are well known throughout Sanctuary. In addition to guarding their homeland, Amazons are assigned to guard the vast Askari merchant fleets.[1]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     History[] Origins[] The origins of the caste lie with the tale of Philios and Askarra, their coupling giving birth to twin girls. The girls grew, and upon hearing tales of the Sightless Eye (an artifact once held by the angel Lycander,) vowed to recover it. Finding the Eye on Skovos, they discovered that while they could not use it to communicate with Heaven, they could use it to see the future. So it was that their culture grew with the Sightless Eye at the heart of their society. From the more stalwart sister, the Amazon Caste descended, while from the more ethereal one would come the Oracle Caste.[4]  Recent History[]  \"When the oracles foresaw the Dark Exile, our warriors trained for millennia. Their vision was proven right when I defeated the Prime Evils. But their predictions did not end there. The demonic hordes would come again. And the Askari would need an army.\"  - Cassia(src)             Cassia trains her fellow Amazons    The Oracle Caste predicted not only the events of the Dark Exile, but that the Prime Evils would return to plague the mortal world again. Thus, the Amazon Caste trained for millennia in preparation for the day in which they would be needed. Their efforts were rewarded when both events came to pass. One of their number, Cassia, joined a group of heroes that defeated the Prime Evils. Yet the oracles' predictions had not ended there—demons would return to once again plague mankind. Thus, Cassia returned to her people to raise an army, rising through the caste's ranks to become its most distinguished commander.[5]  Known Members[] Queen Xaera (ruler of the caste) Warmatron Cassia Palashia References[]  ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 1.2 Book of Tyrael  ↑ Jump up to: 2.0 2.1 Diablo II Manual  ↑ Amazon: Passive and Magic Skills, The Arreat Summit.

Its pelt was hung by the gates, but Tabri ordered the Blades to continue their patrols, and not be complacent despite their victory.[9]           The Blades inside the Chamber of Truth    The Sand Scorpions later attacked Sereth Outpost. However, the attack was repelled. Later, Tabri led the Blades into the Chamber of Truth, where the hero(es) presented her with the last piece of the Scepter of Fahir. With the scepter in hand, Tabri declared herself to be the new ruler of Shassar, and with it, she had a symbol the people of Shassar could rally behind against Vataos. The Amber Blades knelt before her.[10] Later, Peth told the hero(es) that thanks to their efforts, the Blades would retake Shassar.[11] Despite this, the Blades still had to contend with the lacuni. The panther-men attacked a small village, killing dozens and causing the residents to flee. The Blades were unable to retake the village, let alone reclaim Shassar. They requested aid from any able-bodied fighters in Westmarch to help them in their reclamation.[12]  Curse of the Scepter[]  \"Zov? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with Tabri and the others?\"\"Yes, I should! And that is entirely the problem. After you left, Tabri declared war on the Sand Scorpions. She tried to strike against Vataos using the power of the scepter. Completely foolish if you ask me. We were overwhelmed--Chased into this godforsaken library! I was searching for Tabri when I was surrounded by these nightmarish...things! We have to find her before something happens. She still has the scepter!\"  - The Shard-seeker and Zov(src)    After Tabri obtained the Scepter of Fahir, she declared war on the Sand Scorpions. She tried to strike against the Scorpions, but the Amber Blades were overwhelmed, and chased into the Library of Zoltun Kulle. Tabri disappeared during the night,[13] intent on facing Vataos.[14] Using a terminus, she entered the Obliterated Realm using a terminus, but Vataos followed her. In the ensuing fight, both Vataos and Tabri were left in the realm, and Zov obtained the scepter, promptly abandoning the Amber Blades, intent on selling it.[13] With Tabri's apparent death, Peth became the new leader of the Blades.[15]  In-game[] The Amber Blades feature in the Shassar Sea questline in Diablo Immortal. The Light of Dawn armor piece represents their standard attire. An Amber Blades cosmetic set is available.  Known Members[]  \"The Amber Blades was formed of cast-offs just like you...and me. To Vataos, you are already dead. But I'm offering you a chance to fight for something good before you die.

In 1233, she gave birth to her son, Jered. Jered's name however, was a point of contention that added to the growing tension between her and her husband. Cain was far too focused on his studies and role as Tristram's schoolmaster for Amelia's liking. Why had he named Jered after his famous ancestor, she asked, when Deckard's Horadric lineage supposedly meant nothing to him? And why was he never there for his son, or for her? Four years after Jered's birth, the strain in the marriage came to a head, and Amelia up and left Tristram and Deckard, taking Jered with her. They headed east, with the intent of living with her mother. However, bandits attacked their wagon, and both Amelia and her son were killed. Thomas Abbey's men suspected that they had been killed by bandits, but the perpetrators were never found.[1]  Legacy[] The deaths of his wife and son haunted Deckard decades after their death, and he still held onto the death notice he had received concerning them.

Their suspicions turned to the Vizjerei Clan, which was gaining popularity at the time where previously, the clan dabbled in the enslavement of demons. To make matters worse, an unsigned letter that was presumed to be from an Ennead offical was found within the ruins of an Ammuit academy near Caldeum.

Class: Are you Cadeus? Talva Silvertongue said I should speak to you before heading to the nearby village. He believes it's cursed. Cadeus: Cursed? Bah. Nonsense! Fools always claim what they don't understand is magic. No, some creature is causing the village's suffering. The trick is to find out which one and kill the thing dead. Cadeus: If what you say is true, this truly is a dark time...but has no one told you? What stands before you is no temple. It is a prison. Cadeus: A body! It's a villager! Gods, they must have come from upriver! Cadeus: See that? That's no magic! Something injected this man with a toxin. Damn thing's got to be put down! Cadeus: That body came from the village further up the river. If you follow these corpses, we may discover what's behind this. Class: So many dead...and I don't even see the beacon here. Perhaps it's still in the elder's home. Cadeus: Bodies everywhere! The village is lost. W-we're too late to help anyone. Class: I'm going to search for the village elder's home. If anyone still lives, hopefully they're there. Elder Owen: Who...who goes there!?! A thief, here to steal the beacon? Ugh, it doesn't matter... Elder Owen: No, they hunger for their flesh...I feel them... Elder Owen: They're squirming inside--aghhhh! Elder Owen: Akarat...why...why have you abandoned us? Elder Owen: You! Meat...flesh! If they feed...the pain...the pain will end! Class: Stop this! You're not well! Elder Owen: Forgive me...but the beacon won't let me die! Only meat dulls the pain...just like with the others. Cadeus: Oh, no...Owen! Cadeus: That thing in your hand...it radiates a powerful magic...Did he have it? Class: Yes, it's one of the beacons of the Temple of Namari. Could it have caused his suffering? Cadeus: No, the beast you killed did this to him. But that beacon radiates a powerful preservation magic. It was meant to ensure something survived. It must have kept him alive with those things eating away at his insides. Cadeus: What a cruel twist of fate that something so wonderous could have caused him such suffering. Poor, poor Owen. Class: Cadeus, this isn't the only beacon. Talva mentioned another. He said it was held by someone who disappeared into the swamps and was never seen again. Another stone could be out there causing even more suffering. Cadeus: The fetishes...those wretched demons have gotten more bold lately--started attacking settlements directly. If their chieftain controls the power of a beacon, you have to stop them. Their village is to the southeast! Go!

The amount is fixed: only radius and duration increase with the skill level. In other words, Amplify Damage doubles the effectiveness of physical damage, and is most useful against tough Unique Bosses, Champions, and monsters that raise other monsters such as Mummies. As all monsters on Hell difficulty have a minimum of 50% physical damage resistance, Amplify Damage helps a great deal when fighting monsters with very high health such as Über Duriel. This curse breaks the Immune to Physical on monsters, though resistance penalty is greatly weakened (working at only 1/5th effectiveness) in these cases. Due to Necromancer being unable to deal Physical damage by himself (except with basic attacks), it is most useful if one summons a horde of minions to fight for themselves, or when playing in physical-damage focused parties. At level 1, Amplify Damage has a very small area of effect. Additional points into this skill increases the area of effect, but does not further lower physical resistance. As such, more points are generally redundant, particularly for players that have access to +skill items.

In-game[] As with other small foes, Amputators usually appear in large numbers, and sometimes accompany Flesh Harvesters. They swarm the player, attacking in melee, but otherwise have no special abilities. Normally, they are only found in Tidal Cave, but can be summoned to other areas of Greenhollow (anywhere near the open water, most notably the bridge that divides the island).

This is similar to how there are dozens of kinds of melee weapons.  All other amulets are apparently the same base item with stats added on them. Notably amulets have no actual stats as a base item.  So for gameplay purposes this item is probably different to enable the cube recipe to work and prevent this item from being transmuted in recipes that use normal amulets.

It can be found in the bar named Searing Sands Inn in Caldeum Bazaar. It is divided into six parts, each spawned during a related quest. The parts read as follows: 1. Most commoners know Caldeum by reputation if not direct experience. The trade city has existed for thousands of years, predating even the Mage Clan Wars. Its neutral stance throughout the following centuries saved it from the destruction that visited the nearby city of Viz-jun and life - along with trade - carried on. (\"Shadows in the Desert\") 2. The trade consortium council has always been the ruling body of Caldeum, but it gained additional strength after the fall of the Vizjerei. The councilmen saw opportunity in the rapidly growing Zakarum faith, and they allowed the fanatics to build their enormous cathedral, Saldencal, within the center of the city. (\"The Road to Alcarnus\") 3. Not content to reign supreme in commerce and religion, the trade consortium council aspired to make Caldeum a nexus of learning as well. It proposed to unite the mage academics in a massive new structure - the Yshari Sanctum - which has remained a beacon of knowledge and advancement ever since. (\"A Royal Audience\") 4. Caldeum changed drastically in recent years when the Kurast nobles all but invaded the city. Soon after, their emperor, Hakan I, joined them and made Caldeum his capital. Though his actions seemed audacious, he managed to bring further peace and prosperity to the city for the duration of his reign. (\"Unexpected Allies\") 5. All was well under the new emperor until his untimely death forced the Zakarum priests to find a new heir for Kehjistan's throne. Through a series of elaborate rituals (undoubtedly a spectacle for their superstitious followers), they determined an impoverished infant in the north was Hakan I's spiritual successor. (\"Betrayer of the Horadrim\") 6. After the Zakarum priests' rituals were complete, they employed a group of reckless mercenaries, the Iron Wolves, to retrieve the child. They dubbed him Hakan II and installed him on the throne despite his scant years. Caldeum has been in decline ever since, and I can see no reprieve in sight.

Biography[] The Anajinn name was borne by many Crusaders, most, if not all of whom, took on a quest to seek the Light instead of fighting Darkness[1]. One by one, they took apprentices who would continue the search[2], even though they knew that it is probable that Darkness would take them before the Light was found, it was the search itself that mattered.[3] Over time, apprentices succeeded their mistresses, and the search continued.[4] Anajinn believed that Light could be found in everyone, although dimmed, and needing aid from an external source[5]. She also knew that the search would be the greatest test of her life, yet embraced it willingly.[6] The Golden Scourge once belonged to one of the Crusaders who bore  the Anajinn name. She killed many enemies with it, so many that her apprentice lost count, but figured that their corpses would cover the distance from Kurast to Westmarch  - twice.[7] The skull of one Anajinn was fashioned into the Crown of the Light.[8]        GameSpot Expert Reviews     Diablo 4 Review - Mother Knows Best   30 May 2023      Diablo Immortal Review - Evil On The Go   17 June 2022      Diablo II: Resurrected Review - Pile Of Old Bones   29 September 2021     In-game[] A legendary flail known as the Golden Scourge, as well as the Seeker of the Light Set, are named for Anajinn, and apparently were wielded by many of the Crusaders bearing that name.

Quotes[] \"Forgive me child, but you will not stop the salvation of Ivgorod.\" (To the intruders of his lair) \"Join me in the darkness!\" (Emits Mists that swallow the intruders) \"The Mists will spread and blot out the Light of Zakarum.\" (After the intruders escape the Mists) \"As long as hatred survives, so also shall I.\" (Dying words) Personality and Traits[]  \"Join me in the darkness!The Mists will spread out and blot the Light of the Zakarum\"  - Ancient Nightmare(src)    As a nascent consciousness, the Ancient Nightmare's personality was heavily influenced by Sladyan (It spoke of saving Ivgorod).  After Sladyan's consciousness within it was destroyed, the Ancient Nightmare had a basic personality that was defined by its hatred (especially towards the Zakarum), and its desire to spread it's Mist to swallow everything in darkness  Abilities[] Like all nightmares, the Ancient Nightmare's heavily aligned towards shadow element, and can be incapacitated by Light. As a mist, it was capable of draining essence from humans. The essence was then used to create different minions. Because of its corrupted nature, the victims were turned into undead after they died. After gaining form, it created specialized nightmares to harvest essence more efficiently, and control other nightmares. When it gained form after possessing Sladyan, it got many of his abilities, like the high speed movement used by monks. It could perform Piercing Energy and different variants of Wave of Light. It also got better control of its previous abilities over shadow and necromancy like a basic shadow bolt and Bone Spikes. It could also release Black Mists from its body to consume people, though this could be resisted. After reforming, it lost most of the abilities it got from its host, but retained a few abilities like a powerful shield similar to Shield of Zen, and Tornado. It could also vomit a dark fluid which formed pools of darkness which harmed any who stood on them. It has a few crowd control abilities like massive Bone Spikes, and the waller trait.  Trivia[]  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.  The original form of the Ancient Nightmare is actually a black mist. The image in the infobox is the form it took after it possessed Sladyan. After it resurrected, it gained a true form. The conclusion of the Forgotten Nightmares questline implies that the Ancient Nightmare is the consciousness of the Black Mists that was given form when it possessed Sladyan, and is the progenitor of nightmare demons.[5] The likeness of a Veradani Monk's prayer beads revolving around the neck of the Ancient Nightmare's current form hints that it might have retained more abilities from Sladyan.

At the end of the countdown, players gather at the Misty Valley waypoint.  Unlike other world bosses, the Ancient Nightmare actively patrols the Misty Valley. Players have to follow it, even as they attack it. It is surrounded by a powerful shield which must be destroyed before it can be injured. Note that numerous Nightmares are drawn to its location. Be careful not to stay close to the Nightmare for long as the black mist it releases with each step saps health. To deplete the shield and stun the Nightmare, activate Horadric Altars using Zakarum Sigils whenever the Ancient Nightmare is within range of the altar. The Ancient Nightmare only attacks once its shield is destroyed. Completing this event for the first time earns the player Nilfur's Precision.

Its attacks are powerful, but slow and easy to evade.  Swipe: The basic attack of the Nightmare. It swipes down at players with both hands. Bone Spikes: The Ancient Nightmare stomps on the ground, creating massive Bone Spikes that both damages and knocks the player back. Tornado: The Ancient Nightmare raises it's hands, sending multiple tornadoes in different directions. Puddles: The Ancient Nightmare vomits liquid shadow, forming three persisting puddles of shadow for each attack. The puddles remain till the end of the event. There is no limit to the amount of puddles that can exist at a time. They deal light but fast damage to any player who stands on them, and can stack if different puddles overlap each other. Summon Nightmares: Black Mists form at the Ancient Nightmare's feet, birthing different nightmares. Waller: Though seldomly used, the Ancient Nightmare has the waller trait.

It hurls a piercing spear that flies for up to 60 yards and damages all enemies in its path. It cannot bypass walls and obstacles.  Runes[] Ranseur: enemies hit are also knocked back 5 yards. Harpoon: all enemies hit are also pulled back to the Barbarian and Slowed by 60% for 1 second. Jagged Edge: damage type changes to Fire, and increases the damage to 640%. Boulder Toss: The Barbarian hurls a boulder, which hits the targeted location anywhere within 80 yards, bypassing enemies and most (but not all) obstacles. The impact location has a 9 yards radius, no longer pierces in line. The throw now expends all of the Barbarian's remaining Fury (minimum 25 is required for each cast, though), but in return, it deals 20% damage as Physical for every point of Fury expended. Note: effects that reduce resource costs have no effect on the draining of all remaining Fury. Rage Flip: all enemies hit are also thrown 10 yards behind the Barbarian and Slowed by 60% for 1 second. If there is not enough place behind the Barbarian, simply pulls enemies as close as possible.

Andariel and Duriel concluded that the Primes would inevitably reclaim their position in Hell. Therefore, they endeavored to gain favor with the Lord of Terror by protecting his human host.[1] Andariel was thus sent by Diablo himself to invade the citadel of the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye in order to close the passage through the mountains into the desolate eastern lands of Aranoch. During the assault on the Rogue Monastery, many sisters were slain and others were turned to serve Andariel herself.[4] Her foul magics corrupted part of the nearby Dark Wood.[5] By the time Diablo arrived and passed through the Eastgate Keep, Andariel's position of power was well solidified.[1] She sent the Slayer to guard the path between Waystruck and the Rogue Citadel.[6]           Andariel confronts her foes    The brief, yet horrific Reign of Anguish-reign did not last long however, as a group of heroes pursuing Diablo stormed the monastery, eventually coming to face off against Andariel on the fourth level of the catacombs. She not only struck out at her foes physically, but battered them emotionally as well, stirring within each of them; memories of loss, sadness, betrayal, regret, guilt, even as she fed upon on their anger and relished in their despair. Despite the heavy toll on the minds of those whom she attacked however, the heroes managed to and succeeded in dispatching her, sending Andariel back to Hell through the flames that she so hated.[1] Andariel had failed in killing Diablo's pursuers but had still bought Diablo valuable time.[1] Even after her death, the corruption she'd inflicted on the Dark Wood remained, and Fallen made their homes beneath the trees she had corrupted.[5]  The Black Soulstone   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/d/d9/Andariel-BoL.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230601050655\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Andariel-BoL\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/d/d9/Andariel-BoL.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230601050655\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"145\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Andariel-BoL.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Andariel-BoL.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/d/d9/Andariel-BoL.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20230601050655\"></a>       Andariel, as sketched by Lorath Nahr    Due to the machinations of Adria, Andariel's spirit eventually wound up in the Black Soulstone.[7] Andariel was the first essence which Adria marked; the ritual was quick, just as Diablo had promised. As she drew Andariel's soul into the Black Soulstone, Andariel looked into Adria's soul as she tried to subdue hers. The Maiden of Anguish discovered what Adria was trying to do, and fought as hard as she could. Adria later reflected that if Andariel had been fully formed, she would have been defeated. Nevertheless, Anguish's essence was marked.[8] Over 20 years after her defeat, Andariel become merged with Diablo, now the sole Prime Evil left.[7] After Diablo's defeat, all the lords of Hell were returned to the Black Soulstone, with their souls screaming for release.[9] The stone was destroyed by Malthael in an effort to defeat the Nephalem, but he was defeated, and Diablo freed as a result,[10] still containing the essence of Andariel and the other Evils.[11] However, eventually, Andariel's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils.[12]  In-game Diablo II   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/34/Andariel_%28Diablo_II%29.gif/revision/latest?cb=20090510124711\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Andariel (Diablo II)\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/34/Andariel_%28Diablo_II%29.gif/revision/latest?cb=20090510124711\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"172\" height=\"176\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Andariel (Diablo II).gif\" data-image-key=\"Andariel_%28Diablo_II%29.gif\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/3/34/Andariel_%28Diablo_II%29.gif/revision/latest?cb=20090510124711\"></a>       Andariel's in-game model    Andariel is the Act Boss of the first act of Diablo II and is found on the fourth level of the Catacombs. The first rooms are filled with undead and demonic minions; it is usually best to clear them so you can focus on Andariel herself. However, high-level characters that plan on rushing Andariel can safely skip the first two rooms altogether. Open the gates and proceed into the throne room; if you venture far enough, Andariel should approach you, saying either \"Die, Maggot!\" or \"Fear me!\"    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/0/0f/Poolblood.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20080715194520\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Poolblood\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/0/0f/Poolblood.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20080715194520\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"103\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Poolblood.JPG\" data-image-key=\"Poolblood.JPG\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/0/0f/Poolblood.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20080715194520\"></a>       This pool can be used to escape Andariel for a while    It might be best to fight Andariel in the room with the blood pool in the center; you can run around the pool while Andariel chases you when you need to buy some time for healing potions to take effect or to flee back to town via the Town Portal. Andariel uses a potent Poison Spray ability that spreads in a large area: Mercenary units and minions that get hit will most likely die from the poison damage, given enough time. When you engage with her in melee combat, she can still poison you.    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/4/4d/Andarieldead.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20080715194620\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Andarieldead\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/4/4d/Andarieldead.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20080715194620\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"173\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Andarieldead.JPG\" data-image-key=\"Andarieldead.JPG\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/4/4d/Andarieldead.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20080715194620\"></a>       Andariel's remains burning    Though it is possible to limit the damage from the poison attacks by getting Poison Resistance and bringing Antidote Potions, it is probably better to just heal through the poison damage with healing potions or retreating to town to avail Akara of her healing services. Andariel hits for a decent amount of damage in melee combat as well. Just keep hitting her and she will eventually fall (if you run out of potions, you can always portal back to the Rogue Encampment and get some more). Andariel has negative Fire Resistance of -50. That means Fire attacks deal extra damage to her, so use Fire-based attacks or spells if possible. When Andariel dies, her body erupts in a pillar of flame, and the ground shakes as chunks of the ceiling fall down (the debris is not harmful), and a Town Portal opens up, which will take you back to the Rogue Encampment. Now, the way to the east is opened once more, and you can continue your journey to Act II. If you return, the fallen ceiling debris will have \"magically\" disappeared due to the game engine's limitations.  Namesakes Andariel's Visage, a Unique Demonhead, can be retrieved in the game.  Tactics   <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/0/0a/Andariel-death.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080908191308\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Andariel-death\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/0/0a/Andariel-death.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080908191308\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"89\" height=\"242\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Andariel-death.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Andariel-death.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/0/0a/Andariel-death.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080908191308\"></a>     Andariel's death animation    Andariel has a weakness for any fire-based damage, so try to use fire-based skills and weapons as much as possible. Amazons can use Fire Arrow, Paladins can use Holy Fire, Sorceresses can use any fire skill she might possess, and so on. Melee builds can also opt to augment their weapons with rubies or use charms to increase their fire damage if concerned about spending skill points on skills they will use only once. While Andariel's poison can be quite lethal, returning to town whenever the poison damage starts to overtake the healing effect, and returning to the battle is an effective tactic. Here are some helpful hints on how to beat her with different classes: Amazon - Utilize ranged attacks. Using a bow or javelins from long range allows Amazons to stay away from Andariel and possibly dodging some of her Poison attacks. Any damage increasing Fire Arrow or Cold Arrow will help. Barbarian - If dual weapons are in use, then skills like Double Swing are excellent. Mana Stealing/Life Stealing weapons are useful too. Andariel isn't too tough to kill and should go down fairly quickly by good weapons. Druid - Molten Boulder or your best ranged weapon or spell. If you are a Shape Shifter, Werewolf can be good for fast damage, or Werebear for added hit points and damage. Sorceress - The Sorceress is an excellent spell caster. The main downfall for the Sorceress is her weak armor and health but, if she can get Andariel into the room outside her starting room and get her stuck on one side of the lake, the sorceress may bombard her with as many spells as possible before she can retaliate. If she attempts to get within melee range, use Cold Spells to slow her down. Static Field is quite effective here, but keep in mind that in order to use it one has to get perilously close to the Maiden of Anguish. Use it once or twice to drop Andariel's hit points by about 1/3, and then get away. Do not forget that the element of Fire is Andariel's weakness, making spells like Fire Ball and Enchant useful, even on Nightmare/Hell. If you have Blaze, have her chase the sorceress, cast, and enjoy the spectacle. Necromancer - Make sure to kill the creatures in Andariel's throne room before the fight. These corpses will provide a nearby place to raise more skeletons if the necromancer is utilizing summoning skills, but be aware that skeletons tend to die extremely quickly to Andariel's poison. Also, keep a golem in action at all times, as they are good tanks for the weaker skeletons. Use Poison and Bone spells to whittle down Andariel's life quickly while she is distracted, and Amplify Damage is a great way to bring her down. Paladin - The Might and Concentration auras massively increase the Paladin's damage output; direct damage attacks such as Zeal and Vengeance help out too. The Cleansing aura can also help the Paladin and his group if poison is an issue. The Holy Fire aura is also a good offensive tool against the Maiden of Anguish, though this will not add fire damage to any other friendly entities nearby. Assassin - Tiger Strike with a good finishing move can help bring down Andariel. Use traps to increase damage output.  Quotes \"Die, maggot!\" \"Fear me!\" \"The East is beyond your grasp!\" (removed) Diablo Immortal Andariel is referenced in the flavor text of the Blackened Branch quest item.  Diablo III Andariel's Visage makes a return in Diablo III. Andariel's extra appendages can be received as wings as a reward for completing Season 8's journey. The Essence of Anguish Soul Shard can be obtained, representing Andariel.

Personality and Traits  \" Andariel, the Maiden of Anguish, is the counterpart to Duriel.

However, while Duriel reveled in physical agony, she derived pleasure from emotional suffering, believing in the \"purity\" of the emotion. A master manipulator, she set up scenarios in which the victim's mental state was twisted inside out. She loved seeing people torn apart by their own inner agony and emotional pain. Her general bearing is one who is in a constant state of ecstasy, experiencing unthinkable pleasures. Considered one of the most relation orientated of the Great Evils, Andariel was said to abhor isolation, as she sustained herself on the suffering of others.[1] Despite being one of the seven heads of Tathamet (whose body would come to form the whole of Hell itself), she was not fond of fire.[4] Andariel was rumored by some to be very beautiful—at least, as far as Maidens of Anguish were concerned.[13]   Trivia  This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.    <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/a/a3/Andariel-manual.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140905122352\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Andariel-manual\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/a/a3/Andariel-manual.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140905122352\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"233\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Andariel-manual.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Andariel-manual.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/a/a3/Andariel-manual.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20140905122352\"></a>       Andariel    Andariel's nudity in Diablo II generated contention between Blizzard South and Blizzard North. The matter was dropped after she appeared on a gaming magazine cover, with no controversy erupting from it.[14] Andariel bears something of a resemblance to the infested/primal versions of Sarah Kerrigan from StarCraft, by virtue of their statuses as powerful villainesses with deadly extra appendages. Flavor text originally stated that Andariel was the daughter of Lilith.[15] This was cosmically retconned in the Book of Cain, where the author states that Andariel was actually birthed from one of the seven heads of Tathamet, thus preceding all the other demons alongside the other Great Evils. In Andariel's throne room, there is a Bone Throne placed at the back, surrounded by flames, which can sometimes be looted through a glitch. Other than to function as a stand-in decoration, it serves no other purpose. Andariel was voiced by Lani Minella, who also voiced Blood Raven and The Countess. All three of these villains can be found in Act I. In The Sanctuary Tarot Deck and Guidebook, Andariel represents the Queen of Swords card.

Andariel's Visage is a unique Demonhead in Diablo II. Like its name implies, Andariel's Visage is imbued with the Poison attribute of Andariel herself. However, it is the only item in the game that carries a penalty to a resistance, specifically, Fire, which is consistent with Andariel's actual vulnerability to Fire. Its reduction of Fire Resist could be problematic, especially in Nightmare or Hell difficulties, although this penalty could be easily countered by socketing it with a Ral Rune or Ruby Jewel of Fervor for both Increased Attack Speed and Fire Resist. Andariel's Visage is arguably one of the best hireling helmets in the game, as it provides strength, skills, Life Stolen Per Hit, and Attack Speed - all of which are valuable to hirelings. It is often socketed with a 15% Increased Attack Speed jewel to allow the hireling to reach very high attack speed breakpoints (especially when combined with Treachery). Many players will also try to find jewels that provide a second bonus to Fire Resistance to compensate for this helmet's drawback, but with Treachery's Fade ability, the penalty does not matter much in practice.
